无数的怪物嘶嚎着从迷雾的阴影中涌出，鲜血，火焰，尖叫与绝望的祈祷···我们必须杀出一条血路！,"Countless monsters poured from the mist, howling. We are surrounded by blood, fire, scream and prayer in despair... We must fight our way out!"
挽狂澜于既倒，扶大厦之将倾，英雄的使命就是如此，用光明之焰净化那些堕入黑暗中的人吧！,The fate of a hero is to save a collapsing world. Use the flame of light to purify those who became slaves to the darkness!
迷雾中不时浮现出朦胧的未知阴影，像潜伏的野兽一样跟着我们，令人恐惧···,"An obscure figure is lurking in the mist, following us like a beast following its prey. It's horrifying..."
迷雾中不时浮现出朦胧的未知阴影,An obscure figure is lurking in the mist
比怪物更可怕的是人心···乱起时，一些被财货和私欲支配的人们居然化作强盗趁火打劫，他们必须受到惩罚！,"Some people are worse than monsters... In chaotic times, some people are blinded by greed and turn themselves into bandits, taking advantage of the crisis. They must be punished!"
怪物们呲着獠牙，流着酸臭的口水将一群手无寸铁的妇孺逼到了角落，我们必须为了那些不能作战的人而战！,"The monsters bared their teeth, with vile saliva coming out of their mouth. They've cornered a bunch of defenseless women and children. We must fight for those who can't!"
怪物蜂拥而至，首尔在哀嚎与哭泣中绝望的燃烧着···神女的庇护去哪了？我们被神女抛弃了吗？,The monsters surged in. Seoul is burning and the people in it is screaming and crying... Where is Angel's protection? Have we been abandoned by the Angel?
怪物们在围攻神女栖所，守护结界一触即碎，神女危在旦夕···绝不能让神女受到伤害！,The monsters are attacking the residence of Angel. The ward of protection is on the brink of destruction and the Angel is in imminent danger... No harm shall come to the Angel!
更大的威胁降临了，隐藏在迷雾中的魔影终于现身了···必须战胜它！,An even bigger threat is here. The shadow in the mist finally revealed itself... We must defeat it!
魔影重重，兽嚎声声，日出之国陷入了漫长的黑夜中···天照女神在哪？,"Haunted by shadows and howling beasts, the land of the rising sun is plunged into a long night... Where is Angel Amaterasu?"
踏进荒废已久的神社，远处传来的呼救声惊起角檐上的渡鸦，是谁在呼救？发生了什么？,"When stepping into the abandoned shrine, a cry for help in the distance startled the raven on the eave. Who was calling for help? What happened?"
怪物的利爪刺向了神社巫女，怎能让她的生命之花陨落在这种地方呢？,The monsters' sharp claws is going to hurt the Witch in the Shrine. How could we let her die here?
幽暗的长廊不知通往何方，更不幸的是我们在黑暗中迷失了方向···,"We don't know where the gloomy hallways leads to. To make matters worse, we got lost in the darkness..."
黑暗仆从们驱赶着嗜血的野兽加入了战团，他们的灵魂必须用鲜血来净化！,The Dark Servants have joined the legion alongside bloodthirsty beasts. Only blood can purify their souls!
月读的神社前有八千台阶，踏上去，将天照女神解救出来！,Climb the 8000 steps to the shrine of Tsukuyomi and rescue Angel Amaterasu!
月读神社已成为了黑暗爪牙的巢穴，浓重的黑暗气息令人窒息，为了神女，也为了受苦的人们，我们必须前往。,"The Shrine of Tsukuyomi has become a lair for the Darkspawns. It is shrouded in suffocating darkness. For the Angel and for the people suffering, we must go there."
那时的月读喜欢在月下漫步，那时的月读喜欢在花前起舞，那时的月读会在静谧的夜里为劳作了一天的人们送去一个又一个美好而甜蜜的梦，而现在，一切都变了···,"Back then, Tsukiyomi would stroll under the moonlight, dance before the flowers and countless weave sweet dreams for tired people in the quiet night. Now, everything has has changed..."
雄伟的神殿只剩下了几块残垣断壁，残破的雕像似乎在向过客诉说着当年的辉煌与美丽，而今，废墟间只剩下黑暗的爪牙横行。,"The once majestic temple is left with a few broken walls. The ruined statue seems to be telling passersby about the past glories. But now, the ruins are filled with Darkspawns."
黑暗，淹没一切的黑暗，尽头有一盏残喘的灯，我们必须穿过这条危机四伏长廊。,The darkness has engulfed everything. There is a dim light at the end of the crisis-ridden hallway which we have to go through.
鬼影们睁着猩红的眸子咆哮着，稍有不慎便会摄去我们的灵魂，请务必小心。,"The ghosts are staring at us with their crimson eyes, roaring. One mistake and they could take our souls. Please be careful."
长廊尽头那盏灯从不曾熄灭，正如光明从来不曾被黑暗吞噬，加油，我们的勇士！,"The light at the end of the hallway never goes out, just as the light has never been consumed by the darkness. Soldier on, warriors!"
毒蛇吐着猩红的须子盘旋在神殿大门之上，这扇门后会有什么在等着我们？,"The serpent coils itself above the temple gate, poking its crimson tongue about. What is waiting for us behind this gate?"
众神的遗骸遍布神殿，哈迪斯痛苦的张着嘴巴，波塞冬拄着断戟死去，雅典娜，阿波罗···众神陨落，天地失色。,The corpses of gods scattered across the temple. Hades died in agony with his mouth open. Poseidon died holding his broken trident. Athena and Apollo were no exception... The death of gods has shocked the world.
魔盒，潘多拉打开了魔盒···必须阻止她！,The Box! Pandora has opened the Box of Devil... We must stop her!
我们一定要让光明重现人间，那怕阻止我们的是神！,"We must return the light to the mortal world, even if the gods are in our way!"
浩浩乎，平沙无垠，渺不见人，风悲日曛，兽铤亡群，往往鬼哭，天阴则闻。,"The vast plain is desolate and uninhabited. Wailing wind, dim sunlight, and the occasional stray beasts are the only things here. On cloudy days, one can often hear ghosts cry."
天空诡异的飘起了飞雪，曾经的骄阳大漠变得如同鬼域般寒冷···,"Strangely, it began to snow, and the scorched desert became as cold as the land of the ghosts..."
大金字塔耸立在沙海之滨，喃喃的向世人耳语着沧桑与过往——这里是神之墓地。,"The Grand Pyramid sits on the edge of the Dune Sea, whispering the words about the past. -This is the Tomb of Gods."
需要祭品才能打开通往主墓室的大门，而祭品就是黑暗爪牙的生命！,The gate to the main chamber requires an offering to open. The offering is the life of Darkspawn!
“打扰吾等安息之人，死神将张开翅膀降临到他头上！”——墓室大门上镌刻的诅咒,Death shall befall those who disturb our rest! -The curse written on the tomb gate
墓室大门打开后，尖啸的魂灵们喷涌而出，他们是最后的守护者，他们想扼住我们的喉咙！,Screaming souls erupted from the tomb gate when it is opened. They are the last guardians and they are trying to grab our throats!
故事大厅——记载墓室之人生平的祭祀之所，如今，在这大厅中又要上演怎样的故事呢？,Hall of Stories-A place of sacrifice that records the life of the tomb owner. What kind of story will unfold here today?
谎言与背叛撕裂了堕落之神的伪装，太阳终将升起，而黎明的篝火将由我们点燃。,Lies and betrayal have stripped down the Fallen God's disguise. The sun will eventually rise and we shall light the fire of dawn.
此去泉台招旧部，旌旗十万斩阎罗！,I shall summon my fallen comrades and form an army to take down the enemy!
这片森林是活的，它呼唤着你，引诱着你，等你踏进时再将你吞噬！,"This forest is alive. It calls you and seduces you. When you enter the forest, it will devour you!"
白骨累累似深冬雪原，鬼火粼粼若鬼蜮起舞，阴风阵阵如冤魂嚎哭。,"The tons of bones are like a field of snow, the will-o'-the-wisp is like the dancing ghosts and the howling wind is like ghost crying"
没人不思慕美杜莎的美艳，没人敢直视美杜莎的眼睛，没人能活着从这片丘陵中走出。,Everyone admires the beauty of Medusa but no one dares to look Medusa in her eyes and no one has ever walked out of this hill alive.
迷雾从未在这片沼泽上消散，只有缪斯的歌声能引导你走出去，或沉下去。,"The mist has always covered this marsh. The song of Muse could get you out of here, but it could also make you drown."
三生石上看来世，奈何桥头叹奈何，越过这座桥，才能到达开满鲜花的彼岸。,"Read the next life written on the Stone of Life, count the regrets on Naihe Bridge and cross the bridge to reach the other side."
矗立于血色潮汐中的血腥城堡，黑暗之神们正藏身于此，找到他们，杀死他们。,The Darklords are hiding in the Blood Castle within the Crimson Tides. Find them and kill them.
永远不要忘记生而为人的骄傲，那怕对手是神！,Take pride in being a human. Even if you are up against a God!
连通阿斯嘉德与世界各地的彩虹桥，而如今，黑暗爪牙们摧毁了它···,The Bifrost that connects Asgard and the world has been destroyed by the Darkspawns...
神王奥丁的居所，由黄金铸造的宫殿，无数勇士曾在这里豪饮至天亮···不要染黑暗玷污这里！,This palace is made out of gold. It was once the residence of Godking Odin. Countless warriors have feasted here... Do net let the darkness corrupt this place!
“持有此矛者，将统治世界。”——永恒之枪上的铭文,He who wield this spear shall rule the world. -Inscription on the Spear of Eternity
女武神曾骑着白马行走于战场上，赐予无畏的战死者一吻，可是如今，黑暗蒙蔽了她的眼睛···,"The Valkyrie once rode a white horse across the battlefield, seeking the martyrs and bless them with a kiss. But she is now blinded by darkness..."
传说真正的英雄在死后，灵魂会来到奥丁的英灵殿，白天战斗，晚上豪饮，而如今···,Legend has it that the soul of a true hero will reach Odin's Valhalla when he dies. He shall fight in the day and feast in the night. But now...
支撑九界的世界树崩塌了，绝望的火焰撕碎了阿斯嘉德，人们在祈祷，去吧，去帮助他们！,The world tree that supports the nine realms collapsed and the fire of despair has torn Asgard apart. People are praying. Go help them!
大地在震颤，海洋在沸腾，恶魔们坐着死人指甲做成的巨船汹涌而来！决战的时候到了！为了永恒的终焉！,The ground is shaking and the ocean is boiling. The demons are riding on giant ships made of dead men's nails! This is the final hour! For the End of Eternity!
在绝对的黑暗与力量面前，任何的反抗都是徒劳且无力的···,Resistance is futile before absolute darkness and power...
相传亿万年前，天幕崩裂、生灵涂炭，女娲大神以石补天，救万民于水火。而如今，黑暗爪牙竟想对女娲大神不利！,"Legend has it that billions of years ago, the sky was torn apart and creatures on earth were devastated. Nuwa patched up the sky with a stone and save the people. But now, the Darkspawns are trying to harm Nuwa!"
三十三重天的入口，曾有仙人骑鹤，曾有力士开山，而如今，黑暗爪牙占据了这里···,The entrance to 33 planes of existence. An immortal once rode a crane through here. A powerful man once cut into the mountain here. But Darkspawns have occupied this place now...
曾经的造化钟神地，而今却成了怪物横行的死亡山口···,"This place was once a land of marvel, but is now a monster-infested deadly mountain pass..."
始祖神农曾尝遍百草，教授黎庶农耕草药。将怪物驱逐出去！,Shennong has tasted a hundred different herbs and taught people about farming and herbal medicine. Banish the monsters!

这里是火焰的世界，焚尽一切的红莲业火！,This is the world of fire. The fire of red lotus will incinerate everything!
昆仑天池孕育了无数的生命，雪猿、青鸟、鸿雁、白泽···将让光明重新照耀这里！,"The Heaven Lake on Mt. Kunlun has given birth to snow apes, blue birds, swan geese, Bai Ze and countless life forms... Let the light shine over this place again!"
悬浮于天宫之上的神之国度，请借诸天神佛之力助我诛魔！,"The Kingdom of God above the Temple of Heaven, please grant me the power of the gods to kill the demons!"
谁能想到此处曾是丰饶的天国沃土···魔主藏身于此，把她找出来！,Who could've thought that this place was once a land of prosperity... The Demonlord hid herself here. Find her!
魔血腐蚀了这片土地,The demon blood has corrupted this land
堕落的天使们背弃了自己的信仰与责任！,The fallen angels have abandoned their beliefs and responsibilities!
魔血腐蚀了这片土地，堕落的天使们背弃了自己的信仰与责任！,The demon blood has corrupted this land and the fallen angels have abandoned their beliefs and responsibilities!
我记得这条小河，牧童赶着羊群在此休憩，农妇唱着歌儿漂净衣服，上游的磨坊吱悠吱悠的转来转去···而黑暗使一切不再！,"I can still remember this creek, sheperd boy are resting here with his flock of sheep, farm woman is washing her clothes while singing and the mill uptream is grinding nonstop... Darkness has destroyed it all!"
堕落天使赤裸着身体，踏着一地的羽毛婀娜起舞，猩红的嘴唇如美酒般摄人心魄···不要吻下去！,The fallen angel dances naked on a floor of feather. Her crimson lips are as inviting as a glass of wine... Don't kiss her!
天使与恶魔有什么区别？善与恶又有什么区别？你是否怀疑过自己的信仰与坚持？,What's the difference between angels and demons? What's the difference between good and evil? Have you ever doubted your beliefs and resolution?
“万物皆虚，万事皆允，唯信吾之道者得永生！”——死亡圣经卷十一,"Nothing is true, everything is permitted. Eternal life is only granted to those who follow my cause! -Unholy Bible Volume XI"
天使总喜欢审判，无论是堕落前还是堕落后，或许他们只是借助审判来巩固自己摇摇欲坠的信仰吧。,Angels love to make judgments. It doesn't matter if the angel has fallen or not. Perhaps they are using judgments to strengthen their teetering faith.
以身饲虎者有，割肉喂鹰者有，舍身取义者有，敢入深渊一往无前者，亦有！,"Some are willing to feed themselves to the tiger, some are willing to cut their flesh off to feed the eagle, some are willing to sacrifice themselves for the greater good and some are willing to travel deep into the abyss without hesitation!"
黑暗之海，剧毒沼泽，破败之地，燃烧山脉···这是一条注定不平凡的旅程···,"The Sea of Darkness, the Toxic Swamp, the Desolate Land and the Burning Ridge... This is not going to be an ordinary journey..."
南朝四百八十寺，多少楼台烟雨中。,The four-hundred-eighty temples of the Southern Dynasty in the mist and rain their many towers can be seen
雄伟的神殿只剩下了几块残垣断壁，残破的雕像似乎在向过客诉说着当年的辉煌与美丽。,The once majestic temple is left with a few broken walls. The ruined statue seems to be telling passersby about the past glories.
而今，废墟间只剩下黑暗的爪牙横行。,"But now, the ruins are filled with Darkspawns."
黑暗，淹没一切的黑暗，尽头有一盏残喘的灯。,The darkness has engulfed everything.

鬼影们睁着猩红的眸子咆哮着…,"The ghosts are staring at us with their crimson eyes, roaring."
稍有不慎便会摄去我们的灵魂，请务必小心。,One mistake and they could take our souls. Please be careful.
长廊尽头那盏灯从不曾熄灭，正如光明从来不曾被黑暗吞噬！,"The light at the end of the hallway never goes out, just as the light has never been consumed by the darkness."
加油，我们的勇士！,"Come on, warriors!"
毒蛇吐着猩红的须子盘旋在神殿大门之上。,"The serpent coils itself above the temple gate, poking its crimson tongue about."
这扇门后会有什么在等着我们？,What is waiting for us behind this gate?
众神的遗骸遍布神殿，哈迪斯痛苦的张着嘴巴，波塞冬拄着断戟死去，雅典娜，阿波罗···,The corpses of gods scattered across the temple. Hades died in agony with his mouth open. Poseidon died holding his broken trident. Athena and Apollo were no exception... the world.
众神陨落，天地失色。,The death of gods has shocked
必须阻止她！,The Box! Pandora has opened the Box of Devil... We must stop her!
我们一定要让光明重现人间！,We must return the light to the mortal world.
那怕阻止我们的是神！,Even if the gods are in our way!
浩浩乎，平沙无垠，渺不见人。,The vast plain is desolate and uninhabited.
风悲日曛，兽铤亡群，往往鬼哭，天阴则闻。,"Wailing wind, dim sunlight, and the occasional stray beasts are the only things here. On cloudy days, one can often hear ghosts cry."
天空诡异的飘起了飞雪···,"Strangely, it began to snow..."
曾经的骄阳大漠变得如同鬼域般寒冷,The scorched desert became as cold as the land of the ghosts!
大金字塔耸立在沙海之滨，喃喃的向世人耳语着沧桑与过往,"The Grand Pyramid sits on the edge of the Dune Sea, whispering the words about the past."
——这里是神之墓地。,This is the Tomb of Gods.
需要祭品才能打开通往主墓室的大门,The gate to the main chamber requires an offering to open.
而祭品就是黑暗爪牙的生命！,The offering is the life of Darkspawn!
“打扰吾等安息之人，死神将张开翅膀降临到他头上！”,Death shall befall those who disturb our rest!
——墓室大门上镌刻的诅咒,The curse written on the tomb gate.
墓室大门打开后，尖啸的魂灵们喷涌而出。,Screaming souls erupted from the tomb gate when it is opened.
他们是最后的守护者，他们想扼住我们的喉咙！,They are the last guardians and they are trying to grab our throats!
故事大厅——记载墓室之人生平的祭祀之所，,Hall of Stories-A place of sacrifice that records the life of the tomb owner.
如今，在这大厅中又要上演怎样的故事呢？,What kind of story will unfold here today?
谎言与背叛撕裂了堕落之神的伪装。,Lies and betrayal have stripped down the Fallen God's disguise.
太阳终将升起，而黎明的篝火将由我们点燃。,The sun will eventually rise and we shall light the fire of dawn.
此去泉台招旧部,Shall summon the fallen comrades!
旌旗十万斩阎罗！,Form your army to take down the enemy!
这片森林是活的，它呼唤着你,This forest is alive. It calls you and seduces you.
引诱着你，等你踏进时再将你吞噬！,"When you enter the forest, it will devour you!"
白骨累累似深冬雪原，鬼火粼粼若鬼蜮起舞,"The tons of bones are like a field of snow, the will-o'-the-wisp is like the dancing ghosts."
阴风阵阵如冤魂嚎哭。,The howling wind is like ghost crying.
没人不思慕美杜莎的美艳，没人敢直视美杜莎的眼睛,Everyone admires the beauty of Medusa.
没人能活着从这片丘陵中走出。,But no one dares to look Medusa in her eyes and no one has ever walked out of this hill alive.
迷雾从未在这片沼泽上消散。,The mist has always covered this marsh.
只有缪斯的歌声能引导你走出去，或沉下去。,"The song of Muse could get you out of here, but it could also make you drown."
三生石上看来世，奈何桥头叹奈何,Read the next life written on the Stone of Life.
越过这座桥，才能到达开满鲜花的彼岸。,Count the regrets on Naihe Bridge and cross the bridge to reach the other side
矗立于血色潮汐中的血腥城堡,The Darklords are hiding in the Blood Castle within the Crimson Tides.
黑暗之神们正藏身于此，找到他们，杀死他们。,Find them and kill them.
永远不要忘记生而为人的骄傲,Take pride in being a human.
那怕对手是神！,Even if you are up against the God!
连通阿斯嘉德与世界各地的彩虹桥,The Bifrost that connects Asgard and the world...
而如今，黑暗爪牙们摧毁了它···,"But now, the Bifrost has been destroyed by the Darkspawns!"
神王奥丁的居所，由黄金铸造的宫殿，无数勇士曾在这里豪饮至天亮···,This palace is made out of gold. It was once the residence of Godking Odin. Countless warriors have feasted here...
不要染黑暗玷污这里！,Do not let the darkness corrupt this place!
“持有此矛者，将统治世界。”,He who wield this spear shall rule the world.
——永恒之枪上的铭文,-Inscription on the Spear of Eternity
女武神曾骑着白马行走于战场上，赐予无畏的战死者一吻,"The Valkyrie once rode a white horse across the battlefield, seeking the martyrs and bless them with a kiss."
可是如今，黑暗蒙蔽了她的眼睛···,But she is now blinded by darkness...
传说真正的英雄在死后，灵魂会来到奥丁的英灵殿,Legend has it that the soul of a true hero will reach Odin's Valhalla when he dies.
白天战斗，晚上豪饮，而如今···,He shall fight in the day and feast in the night. But now...
支撑九界的世界树崩塌了，绝望的火焰撕碎了阿斯嘉德,The world tree that supports the nine realms collapsed and the fire of despair has torn Asgard apart.
人们在祈祷，去吧，去帮助他们！,People are praying. Go help them!
大地在震颤，海洋在沸腾，恶魔们坐着死人指甲做成的巨船汹涌而来！,The ground is shaking and the ocean is boiling. The demons are riding on giant ships made of dead men's nails!
决战的时候到了！为了永恒的终焉！,This is the final moment! For the End of Eternity!
在绝对的黑暗与力量面前,Facing the absolute darkness and power...
任何的反抗都是徒劳且无力的···,Resistance is futile!
相传亿万年前，天幕崩裂、生灵涂炭，女娲大神以石补天，救万民于水火。,"Legend has it that billions of years ago, the sky was torn apart and creatures on earth were devastated. Nuwa patched up the sky with a stone and save the people!"
而如今，黑暗爪牙竟想对女娲大神不利！,"But now, Numa is under attack!"
三十三重天的入口，曾有仙人骑鹤，曾有力士开山,The entrance to 33 planes of existence. An immortal once rode a crane through here. A powerful man once cut into the mountain here.
而如今，黑暗爪牙占据了这里···,But Darkspawns have occupied this place now...
曾经的造化钟神地,"This place was once a land of marvel,"
而今却成了怪物横行的死亡山口···,"But now, a monster-infested deadly mountain pass..."
始祖神农曾尝遍百草，教授黎庶农耕草药。,Shennong has tasted a hundred different herbs and taught people about farming and herbal medicine.
将怪物驱逐出去！,Banish the monsters!
两仪、四象、八卦，我中华之瑰宝何止万千！,"Ying and Yang, Four Symbols and Eight Diagrams creates millions of artifacts!"
邪魔退散！,"Back off, evils!"
这里是火焰的世界,This is the world of fire.
焚尽一切的红莲业火！,The fire of red lotus will incinerate everything!
昆仑天池孕育了无数的生命，雪猿、青鸟、鸿雁、白泽···,"The Heaven Lake on Mt. Kunlun has given birth to snow apes, blue birds, swan geese, Bai Ze and countless life forms..."
将让光明重新照耀这里！,Let the light shine over this place again!
悬浮于天宫之上的神之国度,The Kingdom of God above the Temple of Heaven!
请借诸天神佛之力助我诛魔！,Please grant me the power of the gods to kill the demons
谁能想到此处曾是丰饶的天国沃土···,Who could've thought that this place was once a land of prosperity...
魔主藏身于此，把她找出来！,The Demonlord hid herself here. Find her!
我记得这条小河，牧童赶着羊群在此休憩，农妇唱着歌儿漂净衣服，上游的磨坊吱悠吱悠的转来转去···,"I can still remember this creek, sheperd boy are resting here with his flock of sheep, farm woman is washing her clothes while singing and the mill uptream is grinding nonstop...  it all!"
而黑暗使一切不再！,But it has been destroyed by darkness!
堕落天使赤裸着身体，踏着一地的羽毛婀娜起舞,The fallen angel dances naked on a floor of feather.
猩红的嘴唇如美酒般摄人心魄···不要吻下去！,Her crimson lips are as inviting as a glass of wine... Don't kiss her!
天使与恶魔有什么区别？善与恶又有什么区别？,What's the difference between angels and demons? What's the difference between good and evil?
你是否怀疑过自己的信仰与坚持？,Have you ever doubted your beliefs and resolution?
“万物皆虚，万事皆允，唯信吾之道者得永生！”,"Nothing is true, everything is permitted. Eternal life is only granted to those who follow my cause!"
——死亡圣经卷十一,-Unholy Bible Volume XI
天使总喜欢审判，无论是堕落前还是堕落后,Angels love to make judgments. It doesn't matter if the angel has fallen or not.
或许他们只是借助审判来巩固自己摇摇欲坠的信仰吧。,Perhaps they are using judgments to strengthen their teetering faith.
以身饲虎者有，割肉喂鹰者有，舍身取义者有。,"Some are willing to feed themselves to the tiger, some are willing to cut their flesh off to feed the eagle, some are willing to sacrifice themselves for the greater good。"
敢入深渊一往无前者，亦有！,"Travel deep into the abyss without hesitation, they are real warriors!"
黑暗之海，剧毒沼泽，破败之地，燃烧山脉···,"The Sea of Darkness, the Toxic Swamp, the Desolate Land and the Burning Ridge..."
这是一条注定不平凡的旅程···,This is not going to be an ordinary journey...
挽狂澜于既倒，扶大厦之将倾，英雄的使命就是如此,The fate of a hero is to save a collapsing world.
用光明之焰净化那些堕入黑暗中的人吧！,Use the flame of light to purify those who became slaves to the darkness!
像潜伏的野兽一样跟着我们，令人恐惧···,"An obscure figure is lurking in the mist, following us like a beast following its prey. It's horrifying..."
乱起时，一些被财货和私欲支配的人们居然化作强盗趁火打劫，他们必须受到惩罚！,"Some people are worse than monsters... In chaotic times, some people are blinded by greed and turn themselves into bandits, taking advantage of the crisis. They must be punished!"
怪物们呲着獠牙，流着酸臭的口水将一群手无寸铁的妇孺逼到了角落,"The monsters bared their teeth, with vile saliva coming out of their mouth. They've cornered a bunch of defenseless women and children."
我们必须为了那些不能作战的人而战！,We must fight for them!
怪物蜂拥而至，首尔在哀嚎与哭泣中绝望的燃烧着···,The monsters surged in. Seoul is burning and the people in it is screaming and crying...
神女的庇护去哪了？我们被神女抛弃了吗？,Where is Angel's protection? Have we been abandoned by the Angel?
怪物们在围攻神女栖所，守护结界一触即碎，神女危在旦夕···,The monsters are attacking the residence of Angel. The ward of protection is on the brink of destruction and the Angel is in imminent danger...
绝不能让神女受到伤害！,No harm shall come to the Angel!
更大的威胁降临了，隐藏在迷雾中的魔影终于现身了···,An even bigger threat is here. The shadow in the mist finally revealed itself...
必须战胜它！,We must defeat it!
巨大的障碍挡在前方,A gargantuan barrier stands in the way...
更加浓稠的黑暗,Darkness is seems irreversible…
愿先知给予帮助,May the prophet light our paths？
知识就是力量,Knowledge is power…
还有一丝希望,There is still a glimmer of hope…
曙光还未完全被吞噬,The first light lingers on...
不行了……实在是……走不动了……,Ugh... I can’t... walk anymore...
不……还不能……还不能放弃,I... won’t... give up!
好刺眼的光芒,… What's the light?
这就是寻找的希望吗,Is this the hope I’ve been looking for?
愿神女与你同在,Good luck will be with you!
这里也撑不了多久了,We can’t hold much longer here!
守住这里,Hold the position!
绝不能让怪物进来,No monsters can get through here!
出发，为了未来而战,Move out. Let’s fight for a better future!
热爱这个世界，绝对要保护它,We must protect the world we love!
下一个目标：Rome,Next destination: Rome
英雄之魂，在呼唤着我,The heroes’ souls are beckoning me！
放眼望去，全是怪物,Mosters are endless…
怪物们，给我让开！,"Get outta my way, monsters!"
有人帮我们开辟出一条道路,Is there reinforcements?
自由与光明的旗帜,The banner of freedom and light！
人性的邪恶产生怪物,Human foibles breed monsters...
怪物就是恶念,Monsters are malice…
人之初、性本恶,Man’s nature at birth is evil...
人类不绝，怪物不止,Monsters won’t disappear unless humanity is wiped out
英雄罗穆卢斯守护着罗马,The great hero Romulus watches over Rome.
这就是英雄的力量,This is the power of heroes!
每一个人都是平凡的,Men and women—everyone is just an ordinary person…
但他们都是英雄,But they are all heroes!
是否还迷惘着,Do you still feel perplexed?
前进，不停地前进,Just march on!

来吧来吧！在死之前我会把你们这些怪物送进地狱！,Come on! I shall send you monsters to hell before I die!
妖！我们来帮你！,Siren! Let us help you!
巴里公主？！你们怎么会在这里？！,Princess Bari? ! Why are you here? !
来不及解释了！先解决掉它们！,It’s too late to explain that! Deal with them first!
公主，谢谢你···谁！谁在你身边！？,"Thank you, Bari…Who’s she?!"
这是大韩熊女的后裔，我们为了消除日本的黑暗而来！,She’s the descendant of Ungnyeo. We have come here to eliminate dark forces in Japan!
我们听说夜神月读囚禁了天照大神。,We heard that Tsukuyomi had imprisoned Amaterasu.
月读···所以怪物们才会暴动！这个混蛋！她背叛了我们！,Tsukuyomi…?! Yes… That's why the monsters rioted! That bastard! She betrayed us!
和我们一起去打败月读吧，把天照大神救出来！,"Siren, come with us to defeat Tsukuyomi and save Amaterasu!"
谢谢你们的帮助！我需要先清理一下伤口。,Thank you for your help! I need to clean my wounds first.
没时间了！我觉得我们自己就可以搞定！,"There's not enough time! Bari, we can do it ourselves!"
好吧···妖，你好好休养，现在月读在哪里？,"Alright. Siren, take a rest here and we’ll deal with the rest. Where is Tsukuyomi?"
我会把你们传送到她的神社。,I’ll send you to her shrine.
女神和巴里公主被传送到了月读神社。,Then the Angel and Princess Bari are sent to Tsukuyomi’s shrine.
谁？谁在那里？,Who? Who’s there?
月夜见尊，好久不见,"Haven't seen you for a long time, Tsukuyomi."
巴里？居然敢踏进我的神社，你在找死不成？,Bari? How dare you come here? I’ll kill you!
住口！叛逆之人安敢在此饶舌！天照大神在哪里！,Shut up! A traitor like you has no right to say anything! Where is Amaterasu?
我的长剑已饥渴难耐！,My sword thirsts for blood!
哈哈哈！我的仆人们，把他们吞下去！,"Haha! Swallow them up, my servants!"
呵呵···我，居然，败在了人类手里···,I never…never thought that I would be defeated by human beings!
他可不是普通的人类，他是神裔，血脉中传承着神的力量！,"She’s not an ordinary person! She’s the descendant of Ungnyeo, and the power of the goddess runs in her blood!"
该死…,Damn…
我居然打败了神？！不敢相信！,I defeated a powerful angel?! Unbelievable!
天照在哪？告诉我！,Where is Amaterasu? Tell me!
天照沉睡了。。。咳咳，她不会醒来的。。。永远！,Amaterasu fell into a deep sleep…（cough）She will never wake up… Never!
你对天照大神做了什么！？,What did you do to Amaterasu?!
世界终将陷入永恒的黑暗！,Finally the world will be plunged into eternal darkness!
如果天照大神就这样沉睡下去，韩国和日本就完了！,"If Amaterasu cannot be awakened, Korea and Japan will be doomed!"
经历了这么多···一切都要结束了吗？,After all we've been through… Is this the end?
我该怎么办。。。该怎么办。。。,…What should I do? What should I do!?
公主！如果韩国和日本都有神的话，那么希腊也一定有神存在！希腊神话中有那么多的神！,"Bari, if there are angels in Korea and Japan, there must be angels in Greece! There are so many angels in Greek mythology!"
对！梦呓女神倪克斯！！如果得到她的帮助，或许我们可以唤醒天照大神！,"Yes! The nightmare angel Nyx! If we get her help, we can awake Amaterasu!"
让我们马上开始吧！,Let’s go now!
出发吧！,All right.
恩！目标希腊！,Let’s go to Greece!
希腊的神社在众神的守卫下得以保存，雅典的守卫者倪克斯击败了前来侵袭的巨型噬魂怪，并将它的核心剖出来，放到盒子里交给潘多拉保管。当伊利斯奉命将盒子交给潘多拉后，无法压制住自己好奇心的潘多拉，打开了盒子???,"The Greek Temple had always been under the protection of the gods. Nyx, the guardian of Athens, defeated the attacking Giant Soulreaver, stripped it of its core, put it into a box, and sent it to Pandora for safekeeping. When Iris handed the box to Pandora as instructed, the curious Pandora couldn't resist the temptation and opened the box..."
我们...到希腊了吗？,Have we arrived in Greece?
...这是哪？,…Where are we?
好像是一个迷宫…,It's like a maze…
...我们要尽快到达倪克斯的神殿！,We should go to Nyx's temple as soon as possible!
巴里！小心！,Bari! Look out!
呼，这里也乱成一团了…,"Phew, this place is a mess too…"
新的敌人吗？这些跟之前遇到的怪物不同,New enemies? They're different from monsters we have met before.
是啊，一些奇怪的家伙。,Yes. They are strange.
我们该尽快离开这里。,We should leave here quickly.
那里有一盏灯，咱们往那走吧。,There's a lamp over there. Let's head that way.
这些怪物无穷无尽！,There's no end to these monsters!
等一下，那边好像有人！！,Wait! It seems that someone is there!
过去看一下！,Let's have a look!
等一下，我们这样打下去太慢了，需要快速提高实力才行，特殊的时期只能采用特殊的办法了！,"Wait a minute, we'll take forever if we keep fighting like this. We need to enhance our power. Well, drastic times call for drastic measures!"
你没事吧？好像伤得很重！,Are you OK? It seems that you are badly hurt!
你是？,You are…?
战斗力上涨了好多！记住，每件装备都会给你带来质的飞跃哟！,"Fighting power has risen a lot! Remember, every piece of gear will bring you a qualitative leap!"
我叫伊利斯，众神的信使。,"I am Iris, messenger of Gods."
这是哪？我们再找倪克斯的神殿…,Where is this? We're looking for Nyx's temple…
这里是潘多拉的神殿。,This place is Pandora's Temple.
潘多拉？？,Pandora??
倪克斯击败了进攻雅典的巨大噬魂怪，将它的核心封印在盒子里将给潘多拉保管，并拜托潘多拉绝对不能打开…,"Nyx defeated the attacking Giant Soulreaver, stripped its core, put it into a box and sent it to Pandora for safekeeping. Nyx told Pandora that she cannot open it…"
潘多拉打开了…,"However, Pandora opened it..."
是的...潘多拉被黑暗所侵蚀，我试图阻止它的堕落，可失败了…,Yes…Pandora was consumed by the darkness. I tried to stop it but failed…
我们可以帮助你！,We can help you!
没错！,That’s right!
谢谢，请跟我来！,"Thank you! Follow me, please."
快到了，潘多拉就在那里！,We're almost there! That's where Pandora is!
要上了！,Go!
来吧！,Come on!
谢谢，勇敢的女神，多亏你们我才能阻止潘多拉的暴走！,"Thank you, brave Angels! I couldn't have stopped Pandora's rampage without you!"
不能把盒子交给潘多拉！它好奇心太重了！我提醒过你！,I told you before not to give the box to Pandora! She's way too curious for her own good!
唉，所托非人，悔之晚矣…,"Sigh… I've entrusted it to the wrong person, and now it's too late for regrets…"
倪克斯，请您让天照大神从沉睡中醒来！只有她能拯救我们的国家和日本！,"Nyx, please awaken Amaterasu from her sleep! Only she can save our country and Japan!"
伊利斯跟我说过了，我会帮你的，等你回去时天照估计就会醒来了！,"Iris had informed me. Don't worry, I will help you. Once you get back, Amaterasu will have awakened!"
终于...谢谢你！,We finally made it… Thank you!
天色在渐渐变暗...,The sky gradually darkened…
怎么回事？！为什么在希腊，黑暗力量越来越强了？！,What's going on?! Why is the dark power becoming stronger in Greece?!
...这是太阳之力被削弱的原因！没想到会是这样！,This is because the power of the Sun is weakened! I didn't think it'll come to this!
倪克斯是什么意思？,"Nyx, what's the meaning of this?"
现在马上去找盖布，他在请求你们的帮助！,You need to find Geb right away. She is asking for your help!
埃及的大地之神盖布？？,Geb? The God of Earth of Egypt??
我会送你们过去的，帮他把太阳拨回正轨！,I will send you to help her to put the sun back on track!
盖布与努特背叛了光明，奈芙蒂斯和其他神一起将神母努特封印在了大金字塔中，而盖布却逃脱了…而对这一切毫不知情的女神一行人，应盖布的‘邀请’，来到了埃及…,"Geb and Nuit had actually betrayed the Light. Nephthys and the other Gods sealed the Mother Goddess, Nuit, in the Great Pyramid, but Geb escaped… However, the group of Angels who had no idea of this arrived in Egypt at Geb's invitation…"
哇！这就是有名的金字塔吗？！好壮观！,WOW! Is this the famous pyramid?! It's so spectacular!
...好奇怪，这里的太阳之力太弱了...到底发生了什么事？,…So strange. The power of sun is so weak here… What happened?
埃及...不是应该很热吗？现在是正午怎么会这么冷？？,"Egypt…Isn't it supposed to be hot here? It's noon now, so why is it so cold?"
援军是你们两个吗？,Are you reinforcements?
吓我一跳！,"Goodness, you startled me!"
请问你是盖布吗？倪克斯说你需要我们的帮助。,Are you Geb? Nyx said that you need our help.
没错，感谢你们的到来。,"Yes, I am. Thank you for coming."
这里发生了什么事？,What happened?
奈芙蒂斯背叛了光明...他封印了努特，使阳光不能落到地面...你们会帮助我，对吗？,"Nephthys betrayed the Light… She sealed Nuit, which prevents sunlight from shining upon the land… You will help me, right?"
我们会全力以赴！,We'll try our best!
这一切都是奈芙蒂斯的阴谋，如果你们能打败奈芙蒂斯并救出努特，太阳就会重新普照人间！我带你们去奈芙蒂斯的金字塔。,"This is all part of Nephthys' scheme. If you can defeat Nephthys and save Nuit, the sun will rise above the horizon again! Let me take you to the pyramid where Nephthys is in."
这就是奈芙蒂斯的藏身处吗？,Is this Nephthys' hiding spot?
是的...我恐怕只能送你们到这里了…,Yes… I'm afraid I can only accompany you up to this point.
啊？！为什么？,Huh?! Why?
这个金字塔中有使我力量衰退的东西...我不能再往前走了…,There are things in this pyramid which reduces my power… I cannot go any further…
原来如此…,"Oh, I see…"
愿你能重现太阳的光辉，愿你的前方是温暖的沙地…,"May you restore the brilliant sun again, and may warm sands guide your path."
我们会尽力的。,We'll do our best.
小心影仆!!!,Be careful of the Shadow Servant!
此处禁止通行！即使你拥有太阳神的力量！,"None shall pass! Not even you, who wields the power of the Sun God!"
命运的谜团...答案就是死亡！,The answer to the mysteries of fate… is Death!
欲求长生？献出你的心脏！,Are you pursuing immortality? Give me your heart!
变成沙漠中的沙子吧。,I shall turn you into grains of the desert sand.
奈芙蒂斯！拿掉这些肮脏的绷带！放了努特！,Nephthys! Take off those dirty bandages! Release Nuit!
你们是谁？盖布！你出来！做个了断吧！不要牵扯无辜的人进来！,Who are you? Geb! Come out! Let's end it all! Don't get the innocents involved!
不要逼我们动手！,Don't you force our hand!
放了努特？休想！,You want me to release Nuit? Never!
奈芙蒂斯，收手吧！放了努特，这世界需要太阳！,"Nephthys, stop it! Release Nuit! The world needs sunlight!"
咳咳...原来如此...你们这些白痴…,(Cough)… I see… You idiots…
嗯？！,What?!
你们被利用了...我在阻止努特的堕落…,You've been deceived… I am stopping Nuit from degenerating…
这话是什么意思？！,What do you mean?!
咳咳...努特被黑暗腐蚀了，我拼尽全力才将她封印…,"(Cough)… Nuit was consumed by the darkness, so I tried my best to seal her…"
就在此时…,At that exact moment...
哈哈哈！这该死的绷带终于被破坏了！我可怜又愚蠢的孩子，你以为这样就可以阻止我吗！,"Hahaha! These cursed bandages are finally broken! My poor and foolish girls, did you really believe that you can stop me with these?"
盖布！！,Geb!!
干的很好，白痴们！多亏你们打开了努特的封印！现在，用你们卑微生命感受黑暗的降临吧！,"Good Job, idiots! Well done for working so hard to break Nuit's seal! Now, offer up your meager lives and feel the power of Darkness!"
该死的！你骗了我们！,Damn it! You lied to us!!
无知的蝼蚁！我是神！低贱的人类怎么可能理解神的意图！,Ignorant ants! I am God! Lowly humans cannot understand God's intention!
你不配称为神！你是恶魔！,You don't deserve being a God! You're a devil!
修我战剑，杀上九天！撒我热血，一往无前！！,Repair my sword and fight to the ninth heaven! Sprinkle my blood and press forward with indomitable will!
好，好，蝼蚁们，感受神的力量吧！,"Well, ants. Prepare to face the power of God!"
怎么会...我怎么会输...我可是神！,How could this be possible… How could I lose… I am God!
糟了！努特的封印完全解除了！她要暴走了！,"Oh, no! Nuit's seal is completely broken! She is going to go on a rampage!"
没有办法了吗？！,Isn't there anything we can do?!
努特！我的爱人！展现黑暗真正的力量吧！,Nuit! My lover! Show them the power of darkness!
呼...还好阻止了努特的暴走，你还好吧？,Phew… Thank goodness we managed to stop Nuit's rampage. Are you ok?
我们...真的阻止了吗？可是...有点奇怪...我的身体...啊！我的身体在燃烧！,Have we really stopped her? But I feel a little strange… my body… Ahhhh! My body is burning!
不！太阳之力太强了！不！,No! The power of the sun is too strong! No!!
虽然阻止了努特的暴走，但直接暴露在太阳之力下的女神却掉进了地狱。。。从地狱醒来的女神要重回人间，必须得到地狱之王路西法的允许。于是女神踏上了寻找路西法的漫漫长路。,"Though they managed to stop Nuit's rampage, the Angel was directly exposed to the power of the sun, resulting in her descend to Hell. In order for the Angel to return to the Mortal Realm, she has to obtain permission from the Queen of Hell, Lucifer. Thus, she embark on a long journey to find Lucifer..."
...这是哪里…,... Where is this…
...清醒过来了吗？,Are you finally awake?
巴里，这是哪？怎么什么都看不见…,"Bari, where is this? Why can't I see anything…?"
真是万幸，神女的力量还在。你能听清楚我说的话吗？,"Fortunately, we still possess our Angelic powers. Can you hear me clearly?"
可以听到...我现在在哪？,I can hear you... Where am I now?
估计...在地狱…,Most likely… In Hell…
...地狱...我死了吗？！,...Hell... am I dead? !
冷静！我正在找让你复生的方法！,Calm down! I am looking for a way to resurrect you right now!
那拜托快一点！,Then please hurry up!
发现你了…,Found you...
你们...是什么！,Who are you?!
我是地狱的守护神——米若陶洛斯！！,I am the Guardian Deity of Hell - Minotaur!!
不要闹了...我很累的...不要打扰我休息…,Please stop the ruckus… I'm really tired. Just let me rest already…
好大的胆子！居然说这种话！我要把你做成晚餐！,Did you really just say that? You've got guts! You'll make a fine dinner!
弑神者！感受被地狱支配的恐惧吧！,Damned God-killer! Cower in terror against Hells' dominion over you!
只要我们不停探索，怪物就会不断出现，我们的女神们会自动战斗消灭他们！,"As long as we keep exploring, monsters will continue to appear, and our Angels will fight to destroy them automatically!"
强化刚刚换上的装备，可进一步提升战斗力！,"Strengthen the gear that has just been replaced, and further strengthen the fight power!"

首尔 清溪川,"Cheonggye, Seoul"
我的大小姐，快一点吧，再晚了就抓不到妖怪了！,"Please hurry up, my Lady! Or we can't catch the monsters anymore!"
妖怪才不会来这种人多的地方呢！挤死我了，小巴，咱们早点回家去吧。,"Monsters won't come to such crowded place like this! The crowd is suffocating me. Bari, I want to go home now."
别抱怨啦，你可是神选之人，怎么一点吃苦耐劳的精神都没有？！,"Stop complaining, my Lady! Please remember you are chosed by God. Why don't you have any fighting spirit? !"
神选中我主要是因为颜值，又不是因为我能吃苦。,"What? I am chosen because of my pretty face, not my fighting spirit."
颜值？！...,Your pretty face?!...
快看！舞台边上有几只妖怪，咱们悄悄过去消灭它们！,Look! There are some monsters beside the stage. Let's sneak up on them and wipe them out!
总算没白来，赶紧抓完妖怪收工回家咯。,"Luckily, we didn't come in vain. Let's catch those monsters quickly and go home."
你看！就这么简单。下一个该你了,Look how easy it is! You're up next.
好吧。神选之人终于要出手了，嘻嘻！,"Well, looks like the chosen one is itching for a fight, heh heh!"
轻松搞定！,So easy hahaha!
早说过让你不要同时召唤三个妹子！后果很严重的！！,I told you that you cannnot summon three Angels at the same time! You will get into trouble!
别！别这么激动，我选一个还不行吗...,Oh! Don't be so excited. I'll pick only one of them now...
就是她了！用剑的小姐姐最性感！哈哈~,I will go with her! Girls with sword are the sexiest! Haha.
就是她了！会射箭的小姐姐最性感！哈哈~,I will go with her! Girls with arrows are the sexiest! Haha.
就是她了！用魔法棒的小姐姐最性感！哈哈~,I will go with her! Girls with magic wand are the sexiest! Haha.
这才乖嘛。恭喜你，今天的教学到此结束！,Great! Congratulations my Lady! Today's lesson is over.
这么快就结束了？！真让人有点不适应啊...,It is already over?! I haven't really adapted to it…
本公主心情大好，决定好好睡一觉。,Princess Bari is in a good mood. She decides to take a good sleep.
巴里公主原来也这么难以琢磨...,It turns out Princess Bari is quite hard to understand…
第二天晚上...,Next night...
求求你，放我走吧，我想妈妈了...,Please let me go… I really miss my mom…
"Auf keinen Fall! Du bist Gottes Auserwählte und es ist deine Pflicht, seine Aufgaben zu erfüllen.","Auf keinen Fall! Du bist Gottes Auserwählte und es ist deine Pflicht, seine Aufgaben zu erfüllen."
可是我只是个来韩国旅游的学生，明天的返程机票早就订好了。,But I'm just a student traveling to Korea and I have already booked my round-trip ticket for tomorrow.
不要在意这些细节，今天有重要的技能教给你：召唤天使！,Don't bother with those details. Today I'll teach you an important skill: Summon Angels!
好像很高级的样子...,Sounds cool…
哇~~~这个小姐姐好酷，居然长着翅膀。,WOW! How pretty she is! And she has a pair of REAL WINGS!
我早就说过这个很好玩。她叫加百列，是一位天使，未来她将永远跟随着你。,"I told you that will be fun. She is Gabriel, an angel. And she will follow you in the future."
跟着我？好酷噢！,Follow me? Awesome!
对，她会陪着你战斗，消灭妖怪。,Yes. She will help you to destroy the monsters!
果然三句话不离打妖怪...,You are always talking about monsters …
这是神给你的使命，赶快让加百列和你一起并肩作战吧。,It's the task God had delegated you. Now let's go and fight alongside Gabriel!
当胜率超过80％，我们就可以去挑战BOSS，只有打败BOSS，我们才能进入下一个关卡。,"Reach over 80% Win Rate to challenge the Boss, beat the Boss, we can go to next Dungeon"
点击切换到布阵界面,Tap here to edit Angels' <color=#FA931AFF>Line-up</color>
加百列果然厉害！很轻松就干掉了妖怪。,Gabriel is indeed powerful! It seems effortless for her to destroy all the monsters.
是的，而你是加百列的主人，所以你才更厉害！,"Yes! And since you are the master of Gabriel, you are more powerful."
接下来，沿着这条路一直探索，还会遇到更多的妖怪，请消灭它们！,You will encounter more monsters as you venture down this road. You must vanquish them all!
哈哈！有天使小姐姐做打手真棒。,Haha! It's so wonderful to have an Angel as a bodyguard!
不是打手...天使是神派来帮助你的，和我一样。,"Not a bodyguard… Angels are sent by God to help you, just like me."
我知道啦，巴里公主是韩国著名的天使，神指引你来帮助我，所以我的旅游全泡汤了...,"Yeah I know, Princess Bari, a famous Angel in Korea, has been sent by God to help me, then my travel plan is gone…"
你这家伙，怎么还记挂着旅游这种小事，你可是神选之人！,Why do you still remember such a little thing as traveling? You are the one chosen by God!
好吧，好吧。请继续你的表演。,"OK OK, please continue your presentation…"
这还差不多。,That's more like it.
小巴，我刚刚捡到了这个…看起来很厉害的样子。,"Bari, look what I just found. It looks very powerful."
这是击杀怪物掉落的武器，赶紧装备起来！,It's the gear dropped from killed monster. Equip it now!
提升自己实力的诀窍就在这里！消灭怪物会随机掉落装备，我们看到小红点提示就要及时换上新的装备。,Here's the key to improving your power! Replace new gears in time when you see a red dot!
果然感觉到力量更强大了。,"Sure enough, I feel stronger now."
是的，一定要记得经常更换最新的装备，这是你变强的诀窍。,Yes. Always remember to change to the newest gear. That's the secret of becoming stronger.
现在打这些妖怪好轻松啊！,How easy it is to fight these monsters now!
当心！他们只是小喽啰，我感觉前方有巨大的黑暗力量！,Watch out! They’re merely a bunch of minions. I sense an immense dark power up ahead!
好多好东西！,So many nice things!
是的，干掉这些小BOSS，会得到很多奖励。神不会让你白干活的。,"Yes, there are many rewards for killing the Boss. God won't let you work for nothing."
好的，我明白了，是不是又该更换装备了？,"Okay, I see. Is it time to change the gear again?"
真聪明呢！不愧是神选之人。,Clever! You're definitely the chosen one.
换上新的装备后，力量真的很强大了！,"With the new gear, I feel I am now stronger than ever!"
及时换上新装备，就可以变得更强！,"When you see a red dot, you should equip the new gear to become stronger!"
是的呢，我的主人。,"Yes, my Master."
主人？？你叫我主人？,Master?? You call me Master?
打完妖怪，现在是不是可以回去休息了！,Area is cleared! Can we go home and take a rest?
口误口误，我是说咱们今天早点休息吧，明天还要去日本呢。,"It was just a slip of the tongue. I was saying that let's have an early rest today, because we have to go to Japan tomorrow."
什么？！怎么突然就要去日本了？韩国我还没好好玩过呢。,What?! Japan? Why do we suddenly have to go to Japan???! I haven't had a good time in Korea yet.
韩国的妖早就被我们消灭的差不多了，日本才是真正需要你去除妖的地方。,"Korea's monsters has been almost eliminated by us. Now, Japan needs you more."
天哪！还要去日本打妖怪？！,"Gosh, we need to go to Japan to fight the monsters there?!"
对啊，机票我都买好了。早点休息吧，嘻嘻...,"Yes, I've bought us the tickets. Take an early break. Ha ha…"
这里的妖怪要厉害很多，看来还得再加点帮手。,It seems that monsters here are much more powerful. I need more help!
嗯呢~这次需要更高级的天使才行！!,"Well, now we need more advanced angels!!"
啊?还有高级召唤？怎么不早说？,What? There are advanced summons? Why don't you say it earlier?
咳咳，高级召唤，有机会获得高级天使。至于怎么做。。。还是我来教你吧~,Advanced Summon comes with higher chances to get high-level angels. Let me show you how to do it~
好险啊，不过终于干掉BOSS了！,"It is dangerous, but at last we killed that bastard!"
这片地区暂时安全了，我们赶紧去其他地区继续进行支援吧！,This area is safe for the moment. Let's go to other areas to help others.
怪物越来越厉害了，再这样下去我们都会死在这里的！,"The monster is getting more powerful. If it goes on like this, we will all die here!"
看来我们需要更加强大的神力！,It seems that we need stronger divine power!
你忘了还有天使吗，她们体内隐藏着巨大的神力，只要觉醒就能释放！,"Have you forgotten these angels? There is enormous divine power hidden in their bodies, which will be released by awakening!"
你不早说，快让她们觉醒吧！,You should say it earlier. Let's awake them!
哪有那么容易？我们需要先去寻找天使觉醒需要的碎片，跟我来！,How can it be so easy? We need to find the Angel Shards first. Come with me!
咦？我好像又召唤到一些命运女神的碎片，怎么使用呢？,Huh? It seems I’ve obtained a few Belldandy Shards again. What am I gonna do with it?
已获得的天使，再次得到足够的碎片可以使她们觉醒，快拿这些碎片去觉醒天使吧！,"Collect enough shards to awaken the Angels you’ve already owned. Quick, use these shards to awaken your angel!"
好！我马上试一试！,"Well, I'll try it right away!"
获取了足够的女神碎片，现在可以觉醒女神了,You have enough Angel Shards and now you can <color=#FA931AFF>awake</color> the Angel
点击选择觉醒目标,Select the Angel you want to <color=#FA931AFF>Awake</color>
点击进入觉醒界面,Tap here to <color=#FA931AFF>Awake</color> Angels
点击觉醒按钮,Click <color=#FA931AFF>[Awaken]</color> button
碎片数量足够，点击【觉醒】按钮进行觉醒,You have enough Angel Shards and click <color=#FA931AFF>[awaken]</color> to awaken the Angel
现在之神，掌控一切！,God of Present! Take control of everything!
好厉害，这就是觉醒的力量吗？,Great! Is that the power of awakening?
走！我们继续清理日本的妖怪！,Go! Let's go on cleaning up the monsters in Japan!
没错！我能感觉到她体内涌动的力量！,Sure. I can feel the power surging in her body!
主人，有了这些女神之泪，就可以让天使们进阶了！！！,"Master, Angels can be advanced with the tears of Angel!!!"
怎…怎么操作？？？,How… how to do it?
请你用心神感受与天使的联系，用神之力浇灌她。,"Use your heart to feel your connection with Angels, and nurture her with your divine power."

奥~~你在这里啊！,Oh! You're here!
弑神者！你打败了涅墨西斯？看来传言是真的！,God-killer! You actually defeated Nemesis? It seems that the rumor is true!
还有一只虫子...受死吧！,You're just a bug… I'll kill you!
饶命！饶命！,"Spare my life, please!"
再来啊！,C'mon! Bring it!
不敢了不敢了...我不配做您的对手…,No… I'm no match for you…
知道就好！我问你，你知道有什么办法能重回人间吗？,"Finally got it, huh! Let me ask you, do you know any way to return to the Mortal Realm?"
逃出地狱啊...也许缪斯知道答案，虽然现在她疯掉了...呵呵呵呵…,"Escape from hell… Maybe Muse knows the answer, but she's mad now… hah-hah…"
缪斯在哪？告诉我！,Where is Muse? Tell me!
可以，不过你要先打倒这些怪物！,"Well, I can tell you. But first, you have to defeat these monsters!"
这片峡谷是美杜莎的领地，非常危险！,This Canyon is Medusa's territory! It's quite dangerous!
美杜莎？,Medusa?
人首蛇身的恶魔，永远不要看她的眼睛，会被石化的！,A monster who has human's head and snake's body. Those who looked into hers eyes would turn to stone!
变成石头？！,Turn to stone?!
不信你就去试试吧???反正我是不会进入峡谷的???如果你能活着的话，峡谷尽头有一片笼罩着迷雾的森林，飘荡着歌声的森林。,"If you don't believe it, you can have a try. Anyway, I will not enter the canyon. If you can live after passing through the canyon, you can see a forest shrouded in mist at the end of canyon, where you can hear songs."
歌声？？,Songs??
循着歌声走，你就会找到缪斯的。祝你好运，我先溜了！,Follow the song and you'll find Muse. Good luck! I'll be taking my leave now!
谁！？胆敢闯进我的领地！！,Who broke into my territory?
歌声啊...应该就是这里了吧…,The song… It should be here…
~~~（歌声）,~~~(Singing sound)
女神缪斯！,Muse!
嘿???你是缪斯吗？,"Hi, are you Muse?!"
~~~!! ~~~!!~~~!!（尖厉的歌声）,~~~!! ~~~!!~~~!!(A sudden sharp voice)
缪斯！！！,Muse!!!
是谁！竟敢打断我！是谁！！,Who is it? How dare you interrupt me! Who?!!
人类~~~~，在这里的人类~~~~？你是~~~传说中的命运之子~~~~？,Human~~~~ human here~~~~？Are you~~~ the daughter of fate in legend~~~~？
...命运之子是怎么回事？,… What is the daughter of fate?
一个预言...流传已久的预言…~~~‘流淌着神之血脉的命运之子会战胜黑暗’?,A prophecy… a long-standing prophecy…~~~‘The daughter of fate with God's blood will defeat Dark Forces’?
你知道如何逃离地狱吗？,Do you know how to escape from hell?
~~~只有地狱的掌控者——路西法~~~，~~~才有办法?,"~~~ Only the master of hell—— Lucifer~~~,~~~ knows the way?"
路西法？他在哪里？,Lucifer? Where can I find her?
~~~命运会指引你的方向…,~~~ The fate will guide you…
那要等到什么时候！我现在就要见他！,When's that going to happen? I want to see her now!
~~~命运如同指南针...要相信命运…,~~~ The fate just like a compass…believe in the fate…
……,...
比地狱更可怕的~~~，是我的歌声~~~（女神一展歌喉，唱出猪叫一样的歌声）,"What is more terrible than hell~~~, is my songs~~~（The Angel starts singing like a pig）"
哦！！哦！！！,My gosh!!!
啦啦啦~~~，请告诉我~~~，去哪里找路西法~~~（女神在这一刻有如波澜哥附体）,"Lalala~~~, please tell me~~~, where can we find Lucifer~~~"
哦~~~~我们伟大的领袖~~~~路西法~~~~~路西法~~~~~~！,Oh~~~~ Great leader~~~~ Lucifer~~~~~ Lucifer~~~~~~！
就由我来为你唱，那神灵堕落的故事~~~~！,Let me sing for you about the story of goddesses' degradation~~~~！
堕落的黑暗之神们~~~，偷了路西法的神器“黑弓”，他们准备用黑弓毁掉地球星核~~~！,"The fallen Dark Goddesses~~~stole Lucifer's artifact [Black Bow], and they intended to use [Black Bow] to destroy the earth~~~!"
路西法非常生气~~~····如果你能带回被盗走黑弓的话，我想路西法会很高兴见你的~~~。,"Lucifer was so angry~~~ If you can take the Black Bow back, I think she will be glad to see you~~~"
黑暗之神？这些邪恶的神在哪里？,Dark Goddesses? Where are these evil goddesses?
血城堡~~~...他们躲藏在那里~~~…,Blood Castle~~~… they are hiding in there~~~…
谢谢你~~~我亲爱的缪斯~~~,Thank you~~~ my dear Muse~~~
随后女神来到了血城堡，遇上了涅墨西斯和莉莉丝…,"After that, the Angel came to Blood Castle and met with Nemesis and Lilith…"
涅墨西斯：快了！终于！,Nemesis: Soon! Finally!
只要拉动弓弦，属于黑暗的新世界就来临了！,"Once the bowstring is pulled, the new world of darkness will come!"
休想！别白日做梦了！,No way! In your dreams!
哦？这里竟然有一个人类？,Oh? A human? Here?
这不是那只碍手碍脚的虫子吗？！欢迎来到地狱！,Aren't you the bug that always gets in the way? Welcome to Hell!
我绝不允许你们用黑弓做这种事！,I will never allow you to do this with Black Bow!
哈！你，和你的世界，永远的在地狱中沉沦吧！！,"Haha! You, and your world! Sink into hell forever!"
快拉弓！快！,"Pull the bowstring, quickly!"
啊！路西法！,"Ah, Lucifer!"
哟，原来你们在这啊。,"Oh, so this is where you all are."
在地狱尽头都能看到你们在打架。,I never dreamt that I'd see you all fighting at the edge of Hell.
路西法~,Lucifer~
莉莉丝，涅墨西斯，你们是想用我的弓封印地球星核吗？,"Lilith and Nemesis, do you want to use my bow to destroy the earth?"
咳咳...地球的毁灭已经开始了...路西法，你无法阻止！,"(Cough)…The destruction of earth has begun… Lucifer, you can't stop it!"
讨厌的家伙！死到临头还嘴硬...,She's so annoying! To think she's still saying such things even when shes' dying!
都结束了...路西法，请把我送回人间！,"It's all over… Lucifer, please send me back to the earth!"
还没结束呢...虽然这两个家伙死了，但他们背后一定藏着某个庞然大物...而且，太阳之力依然很弱。革命尚未成功，少年们还需努力啊。,"It's not over yet… Even though Lilith and Nemesis are dead, there must be something big concealed behind them… Also, the power of sun is still weak. It's not the time for you to rest now."
额...好吧~,All right…
闭上眼睛，要出发喽。,Close your eyes. We're about to set out!
经过千辛万苦，女神终于来到了阿斯嘉德...为了得到永恒之枪的认可，女神通过了命运试炼?????就在太阳之力即将唤醒永恒之枪时，背叛奥丁的堕落之神出现了，念及亲族血脉而不忍心下杀手的奥丁被叛徒反弑而陨落??????,"After undergoing many difficulties, the Angel finally arrived at Asgard… In order to obtain the Eternity Spear's approval, the Angel had to pass the Fate Trials…Just when the power of sun was about to awaken the Eternity Spear, the fallen Goddess who betrayed Odin appeared. Odin couldn't kill her because of family affection, and as a result, she struck down Odin..."
我，很高兴又见到你了！,I'm so happy to see you again!
哦！重回人间的感觉真好！,Oh! It's great to come back to the earth!
无论如何...我很高兴。,"In any case, I'm very happy."
这是哪里？怎么是一片废墟？,Where is this? Why is everything in ruins?
你来了！我是奥丁！你的女神事迹已经广为流传！为了寻求你的帮助，我让路西法把你们传送到了这里！,"Oh, you've come! I am Odin! Your Angelic deeds have been widely circulated! To obtain your help, I've asked Lucifer to send you here."
堕落的黑暗之神涅墨西斯和莉莉丝想毁灭世界！,The fallen Dark Goddesses Nemesis and Lilith want to destroy the world!
显然他们已经开始了，你在地狱的时候这里遭受了攻击。,"Obviously they have already started. You were attacked in hell, after all."
需要我们做什么？,What can we do?
你曾沐浴在太阳神光中，就是使你燃烧坠入地狱的那种光。我需要你将太阳神光注入永恒之枪来唤醒枪灵！,You were once bathed in sun's divine light. It was that light that made you burn and fall into hell.I need you to pour the sun's divine light into the Eternity Spear to awaken the spear spirit!
如何将光注入？握着它吗？,How do I do that? Do I just hold the spear?
不不不！只用通过命运试炼的人才能触碰永恒之枪！,No! Only those who have passed the Fate Trials can touch the Eternity Spear!
命运试炼？！,Fate Trials?!
你已经通过了命运的试炼，永恒之枪已经苏醒，恭喜你，奥丁！,"You have passed the Fate Trials and the Eternity Spear has reawakened! Congratulations, Odin!"
哈哈！快把永恒之枪给我！,Haha! Give me Eternity Spear!
啊！希芙！奥丁的女儿，你在干什么？,"Sif?! Daughter of Odin, what are you doing?!"
发生了什么？！,What happened?!
我终于等到这一天了！永恒之枪是属于我的！,This day has finally come! The Eternity Spear is mine!
希芙...我的女儿，你也要背叛我吗？,"Sif…My daughter, are you going to betray me, too?"
背叛？呵呵...我从未忠于过你啊！,Betray you? I've never been loyal to you!
伊顿！现在阿斯嘉德也是我们的了，对吗？,"Idun! Now Asgard also belongs to us, right?"
哈哈！没错！我们可以用这把枪来征服整个世界！,Haha! That's right! We can use this spear to conquer the world!
你们两个...不可原谅！,You're… unforgivable!
谁引诱你们堕落的？说出来，我可以饶你们不死！,Who seduced you to fall into degeneration? Tell me and I'll let you two live!
呵呵呵...愚蠢遮住了你仅存的那只眼睛吗，奥丁？,"Haha… Is it stupidity that covers your only remaining eye, Odin?"
你无能为力…,You're powerless now…
快说！是谁！,Tell me quickly! Who!
我替他们回答吧...奥丁…,Let me answer for them… Odin…
瓦尔基里！不…,Valkyrie! No…
我们是神！不是愚蠢而又邪恶的人类的保姆！你早该放弃他们了！是你背叛了我们！,We are Goddesses! We're not babysitters to those foolish and evil humans! You should have given them up! You are the one who betrayed us!
我不会放过你们的！！！,I will never let you all get away with this!
瓦尔基里，我不会原谅你的…,"Valkyrie, I will not forgive you, never!"
呵呵！当年纵横九界的神王奥丁去哪了？怎么弱到了这个地步？,"Haha! Where is the powerful queen of Asgard, Odin? Why are you so weak now?"
瓦尔基里！你怎能这样...奥丁这么相信你…,Valkyrie! How can you do this… Odin trusted you so much…
是啊，他相信我，所以呢？现在阿斯嘉德是我的了！这个世界也会属于我！去地狱和奥丁作伴吧！,"Yes, she trusted me. So what? Now Asgard is mine! I will rule the world! Time for you to join Odin in Hell!"
我不推荐在地狱见面…,Hell is not a place I'd recommend to meet in…
为了奥丁！瓦尔基里，我发誓会亲手杀死你！,"For Odin! Valkyrie, I swear that I will kill you one day!"
那你要加油哟，我在阿斯嘉德的王座上等着你！现在我有要紧事去做，没空陪你们玩了，哈哈！,"Then do try your very best. I'll be waiting for you while sitting on the throne of Asgard! Now, I have other urgent matters to attend to, so I won't be wasting more time entertaining you. Haha!"
我需要两位的帮助！请一定要保护好阿斯嘉德！,"I need your help! Please, protect Asgard!"
咳咳...以为打败我就可以了吗？我的主人???请向这些卑微的蝼蚁展现真正的绝望与黑暗的力量！！,"(Cough)…You think that everything will be fine once you beat me? My lord, please show the power of despair and darkness to these humble ants!"
小心脚下！阿斯嘉德在崩塌！小心！,Watch your step! Asgard is collapsing! Be careful!
啊！,Ahh!
人类...愚昧无知的存在…,Human being… an existence of ignorance…
你...你是谁？,Who… who are you?
黑暗之主...混乱之神...太古幽冥大君…,I am lord of darkness… goddess of chaos… queen of Nether world…
什么乱七八糟的！！,What?!!!
臣服...或是死亡！,Surrender… or die!
阿斯嘉德的崩碎了，危急关头，创世之神女娲伸出援手，救下了女神。从女娲口中得知，唯有圣剑轩辕才能彻底消灭厄瑞玻斯，为此，女神走进了茫茫的昆仑山，踏上了寻剑之旅,"Asgard was collapsing. In the critical moments, the Creation Goddess Nuwa saved Angel. From Nuwa, she knew that only Xuanyuan Sacred Sword could completely eradicate Erebus. For this reason, Angels walked into the vast Kunlun Mountains and embarked on a sword-seeking journey."
啊啊啊啊啊！！,Ahhh!
你醒了。,You're awake.
...我是在做梦吗？你是谁？这是哪里？,…Am I in dream? Who are you? And where is this?
我叫女娲，这里是我的神宫。我看到你从世界之喉跌下，就把你救了下来。,I am Nuwa and here is my shrine. I saw you fall from Throat of World and then saved you.
世界之喉...你是说阿斯嘉德吗？,Throat of World… You mean Asgard?
女娲大人，可以再说一遍您跟我说过的话吗？,"Nuwa, could you please repeat what you said to me?"
什么话？,What?
创世之初，神分两极，阳者曰明，阴者曰暗，阴阳相合，万物生长，直到人类开始质疑神的权威…,"At the beginning of the creation, the Goddesses were divided into two polarities: one was the Light, and the other was Darkness. With both Light and Darkness in balance, all in existence flourishes. Until one day, humans began to question the authority of the Goddesses..."
...所以世界是这个样子的…,…So this is why the world is like this…
现在，能阻止厄瑞玻斯的只有你了，命运之子！,"Now only you can stop Erebus, daughter of fate!"
...我的实力...太弱了…,… My power… is so weak ...
有一个办法...找到曾经封印厄瑞玻斯的圣剑轩辕！,There is a way. That is to find Xuanyuan Sacred Sword which sealed Erebus in the past!
轩辕剑...在哪里？,Where is the Xuanyuan Sword?
在西王母的洞府昆仑山...不过西王母被厄瑞玻斯的力量腐蚀堕落了...但是我相信你，你一定能寻回轩辕剑的！,"In Xiwangmu's shrine, Kunlun Mountain…Sadly, Xiwangmu was influenced by Erebus' power and has degenerated… Anyway, I trust you. I'm sure that you can find Xuanyuan Sword!"
可我不知道自己能不能行…,But I don't know whether I can do it or not…
别担心...我从你眼中看到了力量与希望...经过神农、伏羲、祝融把守的关卡，你就能到达昆仑山。要记住，找到圣剑后要马上回来。,"Don't worry… I see strength and hope in your eyes… After going through the Gates guarded by Shennong, Fuxi and Zhurong, you will arrive at Kunlun Mountain. Remember to come back soon once you find the Xuanyuan Sword."
与女娲分开后，在昆仑天宫，遇见了神农…,"After separating from Nuwa, the Angel met with Shennong in Kunlun Mountain…."
犯我境者，虽远必诛！,"I will kill those who has invaded my territory, no matter how far they go!"
我只想过去...没办法了…,But I just want to pass by… Guess I've got no choice…
太极生两仪，两仪生四象，四象生八卦！,"Taiji generates two complementary forces, and two complementary forces generate four aggregates. Then the four aggregates generate eight trigrams!"
这就是八卦阵吗？？,Is this the Eight-Trigram Array?
准备好进入火焰世界了吗？,Are you ready to enter the Realm of Fire?
这是最后一个…,This is the last one…
谁？好大的胆子！,Who is that?! How impertinent!
...我是来取轩辕剑的！,…I've come to take the Xuanyuan Sword!
去死吧！,Go to hell!
呵呵~,Ha-ha~
女娲大人！我找到轩辕剑了！,"Nuwa, I've found the Xuanyuan Sword!"
干得好！听好，现在你的力量还不足以控制轩辕剑，从目前的状态来看，你只能使用一次，你必须把握好机会，给予厄瑞玻斯致命一击！,"Well done! Now listen, you don't have enough power to control the sword at your present state. From what I can see, you can only use it once, so you must seize a good opportunity to strike a deadly blow to Erebus!"
快！现在使用轩辕剑！,Quick! Use the Xuanyuan Sword now!
快！,Quick!
我控制不了轩辕剑！啊！,I can't control it! Ahhhh!!
轩辕剑打歪了！厄瑞玻斯逃走了！,The Xuanyuan Sword missed! Erebus escaped!
虽未击中命门，厄瑞玻斯还是受到了重创。在堕落天使的保护下，厄瑞玻斯遁入陨神峡谷，藏身其间修复创伤。女神紧随其后追至…,"Although the attack missed the target, Erebus was still seriously injured. Protected by fallen Angels, she hid herself in Canyon of Fallen Goddesses to heal her wounds. The Angel gave pursuit…"
厄瑞玻斯逃走了！我们去追他吧！,Erebus escaped! Let's chase after her!
呼呼（喘粗气）...等一下…,(Puffing)…Give me a second...
你没事吧？是不是受伤了？,Are you ok? Have you been injured?
呼呼...休息一会就好了…,(Puffing)… I just need a rest…
你先休息，我去跟踪厄瑞玻斯！,Take a rest here. I'll follow Erebus!
过了一会儿…,After a while…
厄瑞玻斯被堕落的天使护卫着躲进了神之峡谷！,"Protected by fallen Angel guards, Erebus entered the Canyon of Fallen Goddesses!"
幸苦你了，咱们出发吧！,You've worked hard. Let's go!
你的身体还好吧？,How are you?
我没事...现在是千载难逢的好机会...不能错过！,I'm fine… It's a rare opportunity… I can't miss it!
（我的能量波动好奇怪...好像混合着其他气息...）,(My power fluctuates strangely ... as if mixed with other things...)
（这种气息是...厄瑞玻斯的黑暗能量！）,(It is…Erebus' dark power!)
肮脏的人类！我将净化你的灵魂！,Dirty human being! I will purify your soul!
废话少说！,Cut the crap.
人类，接收命运的审判吧！,"Human, accept the judgment of fate!"
有罪的人是你！,The guilty one is you!
聆听死亡的号角吧！放弃无谓的挣扎！,Listen to the horn of death! Give up the unnecessary struggle!
你们不配称为神！,You are not worthy to be called Goddesses!
大天使米迦勒！！到此为止吧！厄瑞玻斯在哪里？,Archangel Michael!! Let's put an end to this! Where is Erebus?
神域怎允许卑鄙的人类涉足！离开！,Despicable human beings cannot enter the realm of Goddess! Go away!
神？你们还自称为神？！你们是堕落的魔鬼！,Goddesses? You call yourselves goddesses?! You are fallen devils!
人类竟然也敢冠冕堂皇的说堕落？！这一切都是因为你们！你们这些愚昧，贪婪，无耻，邪恶的蛀虫！只有黑暗才能彻底的净化世界！才能创造一个新的神国！没有人类！,"How dare humans talk about degeneration?! All this is because of you! You are foolish, greedy, shameless and evil! Only darkness can completely purify the world! Only then can we create a new kingdom of goddesses! No humans in it!"
可人类是你们创造的啊！人类是你们的子民！,But humans are created by you! Humans are your people!
这是我们唯一的污点！只有将你们抹去才能还世界清白！,This is our only stain! Only by eradicating humans can the world be innocent again!
为了治愈轩辕剑带来的创伤，厄瑞玻斯找到了在地球核心休眠的万神之母盖亚，在杀死神母后，厄瑞玻斯吸收了盖亚的能量重生了……,"To heal her wounds caused by Xuanyuan Sword, Erebus found Gaia, the mother of gods, who was dormant in the core of the earth. After killing her, Erebus absorbed Gaia's energy and was reborn…"
厄瑞玻斯在哪里？,Where is Erebus?
厄瑞玻斯回到母亲身边了，你是不可能阻止他的！,Erebus has returned to her mother's side. You cannot stop her!
厄瑞玻斯的母亲...盖亚！！,Erebus' mother… Gaia!!
万神之母盖亚？,"Gaia, Mother of Gods?"
没错...他想要窃取母神之力来修复自己被轩辕剑打烂的身体。,"Yes… She wants to steal Gaia's power to heal her body, which was hurt by Xuanyuan Sword."
现在该怎么办？,What should we do?
去盖亚的栖所。,Go to where Gaia is.
在哪？,Where's that?
地球的深处...这将是一段漫长的旅途...,In the depths of the earth… It will be a long journey…
住手！厄瑞玻斯！她可是你的母亲！,"Stop! Erebus, she is your mother!"
只有你们人类才在乎所谓的亲情，被情感羁绊的你们是不可能成为永恒的神的！,"Only humans care about the so-called family affection, and that's why you can not become eternal Gods!"
小心！！厄瑞玻斯吸收了盖亚全部的能量！,Watch out!! Erebus has absorbed all Gaia's energy!
一切到此为止吧！,Let's put an end to this!
不...为什么会是这样！为什么...母亲！！,No…Why is this happening?! Why…Mother!!
终于...我们成功了！看，有光！光明正在回归！绝望的灵魂消失了！,"Finally… we did it! Look, it's light! The Light is coming back! The desperate souls disappeared!"
嗯...太棒了...一切...都结束了...,Mm… Great… Everything… Is over…
不！发生了什么事！振作一点！不！,No! What's happening?! Pull yourself together! No!
厄瑞玻斯释放了黑暗能量侵蚀了女神的神魂，黑暗妖女莉莉丝在女神精神世界中重生，女神意识中的七宗罪——傲慢’、‘嫉妒’、‘愤怒’、‘懒惰’、‘贪婪’、‘暴食’、‘淫欲’被无限放大。我们的女神，能战胜自己吗？,"Erebus released a dark energy, eroding the Angel's soul, and the dark demoness Lilith was reborn in the Angel's spiritual world. Meanwhile, the seven deadly sins in her consciousness, 'Pride', 'Envy', 'Wrath', 'Sloth', 'Greed', 'Gluttony', and 'Lust' are infinitely magnified. Can the Angel defeat herself?"
这是哪...不是都已经结束了吗？巴里，巴里...你在哪？,"Where is this...Isn't it all over? Bari, Bari…Where are you?"
该起床喽~,It's time to get up~
你是...莉莉丝？,Are you… Lilith?
咯咯！谢谢你还记得我！,Haha! Thank you for remembering me!
你不是已经…？,Aren't you already...?
死了对吗？呵呵呵，死亡只是人类世界才有的概念，神是不会死的！我们是永恒的存在！死亡？我们只不过是在物质世界暂时隐藏了痕迹而已。,Dead? Death is just a concept of human world. Goddesses will not die! We are eternal beings! Death? We just temporarily hide our traces from the physical world.
莉莉丝...一阶都结束了...厄瑞玻斯已经烟消云散了，收手吧！,Lilith… everything is over… Erebus has vanished. Just stop.
结束了？谁说的？呵呵呵，看看你现在的样子！不要再隐藏了，直面最真实的自己吧！,"Everything is over? Says who? Haha, look at yourself! Stop hiding and be true to yourself!"

到达！众神的国度,Arrivals! Kingdom of the gods!
为何这么荒凉,Why so desolate?
前面好像充满了危险,The front seems full of danger.
小心！那是什么怪物？,Be careful! What kind of monster is that?
这些怪物好像拥有神的力量,These monsters seem to have the power of God!
他们是堕落的神,They are fallen gods!
终于打败他们了,Finally beat them!

我好像不能控制自己了,I don't seem to be able to control myself!
是谁在帮我,Who is helping me?
最后的神，其他神去了哪里,"The last god, where did the other gods go?"
原来神也会被恶念侵蚀,God is also eroded by evil thoughts.
通过试炼，就可以继承神的力量,"Through trials, I can inherit the power of God!"
我会坚持到底，决不放弃,"I will stick to it, never give up!"

美丽往往和危险并存,Beauty often coexists with danger.
来吧，让火焰更猛烈一些吧！,"Come on, let the flames be more intense!"
今晚要吃烤狗肉,Toasted dog meat tonight!
真是难缠的家伙,Really a tough guy…
但我决不放弃,But I never give up!
坚持！怪物越来越少了,Hold on! Victory is at hand!
胜利之光就在眼前,The light of victory is here!
前面有个古怪的老头,There is a weird old man in front.
走到这里，怎么还会后退,How come you come back here?
魔界的入口，像是恶魔的眼睛,"The entrance to the demon world,like the eyes of a demon!"
希望之光不会消散,The light of hope never dissipate!

魔神撒旦的佩剑，傲慢的撒旦想要和耶和华同等，召集了三分之一的天使走向堕落之路。,"Satan's sword, the arrogant Satan wanted to be equal to the Lord, so he called a third of the angels to Fall."
吞噬一切的海怪利维坦的头骨锻造而成的头盔，饱含了幽居深海的不甘和对地上一切事物的嫉妒恶念。,"The skull of Leviathan, the all-consuming sea monster, is forged into a helmet imbued with a deep-sea reluctance and jealousy of everything on earth."
地狱魔王萨麦尔的战甲，甲胄完全被他的怒火所淬炼，凡人即使是伸手触碰也会怒火焚身，灰飞烟灭。,Samael's armor is tempered by his wrath. Mortals will burn themselves to ashes when they get close to it.
原亚述的魔神贝尔芬格手中的神秘书籍，记载着散播不和以及诱人怠惰使人坠入邪恶的法门。,"The mysterious books of Belphegor, the Early Assyrian demon god, record the ways of spreading discord and seducing laziness to bring one down to evil."
财宝和贪婪的错误之神玛门的戒指，被戒指反光照到的人会化为行尸走肉，沉溺于难以抑制的物欲而开始疯狂无休止的索求。,"The ring of Mammon, the god of treasure and greed, and the person who is illuminated by the ring will turn into a walking dead, addicted to unquenchable desire for material things and begin a frenzy of endless demands."
色欲魔神阿斯莫德的眼睛，直视眼睛的人可能会获得真知，也可能被色欲蒙蔽，永堕第二层地狱。,"The eyes of Asmodeus, Those who look straight into the eyes of Asmodeus may gain true knowledge, or they may be blinded by lust and fall into the second hell forever."

没错人类，这样才值得我去打败你，让我们都拼尽自己的所有来让这场战斗完成它的使命。,"You are worth to defeat, let's do our best in this battle to complete our missions."
我要输了吗？神的判断有时也会没那么准，但是我仍然会认真的和你战斗至最后一刻。,"Will I lose? Gods can not predict everything. Until the last moment, I will still fight with you."

末日代表着旧时代的结束，而将会迎来怎样的新时代，末日号角并未给出它的答案。,The doomsday represents the end of the old era. What new era will usher in? The horn of doomsday does not give its answer.
代达罗斯建造的异常复杂混乱的迷宫，但即使再复杂的迷宫，也无法成为米洛斯的遮羞布。,"Daedalus built an unusually complex and chaotic maze. But no matter how complicated it is, it cannot be a cover for Milos."
这是一个关于艺术与欢乐的故事，竖琴在以它自己的方式默默细述着这段回忆。,"This is a story about art and joy, and the harp silently recounts this memory in its own way."
充满神器力量的香炉，能辟邪、招百福，也给熊女带来奇特的力量。,"The censer is full of magical power. It can ward off evil spirits, attract blessings, and gives peculiar power to the Ungnyeo."
长三尺六分六寸，上有五弦：曰、宫、角、徵、羽。\n琴声能道天地之德，能表神农之和，也能给人们带来欢乐。,"Shennongqin has five strings on it: Yue, Gong, Jiao, Zheng, Yu. \nThe sound of it can express the virtue of heaven and earth and bring happiness to people."
拉斐尔带着智天使的头衔，是强大实力的代表。\n在寒冬的夜晚，更是能够温暖和治愈人心的存在。,"Raphael owns the title of Wisdom Angel. This is representative of powerful strength. \nIn the night of winter, it is the existence that can warm and heal people's hearts."
当回过神来，手已被刺痛。\n伤疤被时间治愈，心却依旧为了玫瑰而疼痛。\n心早已被偷走，甘愿化为这血池中的一滴。,"When he came back to his senses, the hand was tingled. \nThe scar is healed by time, but the heart was sad by rose. \nThe heart has been stolen, willing to turn into a drop in this pool of blood."
裹灵布是神圣的、纯洁的。但是正是如此，盖布将它们用来包裹那一个个罪恶的灵魂。\n埋葬于大地之下，永世无法逃出。,"The wrapper is sacred and pure. Geb used them to wrap the sinful souls. \nBuried under the earth, there is no way to escape forever."
耀眼夺目，犹如金黄的麦穗或是地里的黄金。\n即使如今金丝编制而成如此永恒桂冠，却也怎样都无法回到那年夏天。,"It is dazzling, like golden wheat in the ground. \nEven if the gold thread is now woven into such an eternal laurel, there is no chance to return to that summer."
记忆被苦难模糊，仅存的欢乐被死亡漂白。\n对于来到冥界的灵魂，这仍然是心驰神往的彼岸。,"Memories are blurred by suffering and joy is taken away by death. \nFor the souls who came to the underworld, it is still the other side of the heart."
命运之书到底是正在被书写，还是早已成册，没有人知道。\n正如薛定谔的猫，在打开盒子之前，你终究无法确定你自己的命运。,No one knows their fate on Book of Destiny. \nYou will know nothing about your life until you open the fate box.
光可以散漫的划破一片片夜空，光可以直直的照进人的内心。\n但光会被黑洞吸收，光也得遵循倪克斯的月夜法则。,"Light can scribble through the night sky, and light can shine straight into people's hearts. \nBut light will be absorbed by black hole and it also follows Nyx's Moon Night Law."
花微果小，三千年一熟，人吃了成仙了道，体健身轻；\n层花甘实，六千年一熟，人吃了霞举飞升，长生不老；\n紫纹缃核，九千年一熟，人吃了天地同寿，日月同庚。——《西游记》,"The flowers and the fruits are small. Myth Peach were riped for three thousand years, when people ate them, they will become immortals and their body will be be light; \n Myth Peach were riped for six thousand years, when people ate them will be soaring and living forever; \n Myth Peach were riped in nine thousand years, when people ate them, their lives will be as long as the world living."
伊利斯作为含义为王座，法老是伊利斯的孩子，坐在她提供的御座上。伊利斯能用她的王座保护着幼童和亡灵，也能用她的王座复活死者。,"Iris as the meaning of the throne provided the throne to pharaoh who is Iris' child. Iris can use her throne to protect young children and dead people,  also she can also use her throne to resurrect the dead."
普通的武器：在撕裂大地、在击碎岩石、甚至在使天地崩塌。\n海神三叉戟：普通的武器可以的，它都可以，它还可以撕裂宇宙，使冥界暴露。,"Ordinary weapons: tearing the land, crushing rocks, and collapsing the earth. \nPoseidon's Trident: It can do what Ordinary weapons can do. Also it can tear the universe and expose the underworld."
方塔苏斯什么技能都会，她能幻化成世上万物的模样，但是从来没有人见过方塔苏斯本来的模样，或许她也忘记了自己原本是什么样,"Phantasos knew every skill and she can transform into the appearance of everything in the world. No one has ever seen the original appearance of Phantasos, maybe she has forgotten what she was originally."
不要温顺的走近那个良夜，不要在如此让人心安的歌声中沉睡，才能免于坠入她们的血盆大口。,Don't approach the good night in the night and fall asleep in such a comfortable song to avoid falling into their mouths.
透过美丽的瞳，看到了你和美杜莎一起走过的旅途。\n美丽、纯洁、好似一段遥不可及的梦，但又让你愿意不断去追寻，直到身体和灵魂慢慢石化。,"Through the beautiful eyes, I saw you and Medusa are in the journey. \nIt is beautiful and pure. It likes an unattainable dream, but it makes you willing to pursue it until your body and soul slowly petrify."
为了寻找心中的唯一踏上了旅程。\n走走停停，曲曲折折，但是只要方向坚定，胜利女神终会将桂冠戴在你头上。,"Embarked on a journey to find the only one in my heart. \n The road is torturous and complicated in journey, but as long as your firm direction , the angel of victory will eventually wear a laurel crown on your head."
罪孽会化为丝线，逐渐缠绕包裹着你让你喘不过气，直到被涅墨西斯用她无情的正义斩开，连带着你的躯体和灵魂。,"Sins turn into silk threads and gradually wrap around you. You cannot breathe. Your body and soul will die unless the silks are cut through by Nemesis.\nEven in her merciless justice, death is inevitable as she cuts through the silks, down into your very soul."
日月星辰都在她的穹顶之下消亡又再生、大地上的亿万生命在她的庇护下一代一代的轮回。,"The sun, moon and stars all perish and regenerate under her dome. Hundreds of millions of lives on the earth are sheltering the reincarnation of the next generation."
贞德在村后的大树下遇见天使，得到了“上帝的启示”，她举起了反抗的军棋，率领她的将兵打赢了战争。这面旗子跟着她战斗在战争的第一线却从来没有被折断，时常能降下神谕，给予贞德帮助。,Jeanne d'Arc met an angel under the big tree behind the village and received 'God's revelation'. She raised the rebellious war flag and led her generals to win the war. This flag followed her in the battle on the front lines of the war but was never broken. The oracles from flag often helped Jeanne d'Arc.
当青春之鸟不在，当青春被秋风掳去。\n唯有青春苹果能带给人们那繁茂的春之元气。,When the bird of youth is not there and it was captured by the autumn wind. \nOnly youth apples can bring vigor and hope to people.
还是襁褓中的婴儿被遗弃，生命本该如此折损。\n但喜鹊飞来守护，金龟背着游进大海，佛祖搭救并交给花子收养。\n当有一天长大成人，其成长将会带给生灵治愈更多。,"The baby in the swaddle was abandoned and life shouldn't have been so damaged. \nThe magpie was flying to guard and the golden tortoise swam into the sea with the baby on its back. Buddha rescued her and handed it to Huazi for adoption. \nWhen this baby growed up, she will bring more healing to the creatures."
“古者包牺氏之王天下也，仰则观象雨天，俯则观法于地；观鸟兽之文与地之宜；近则诸身，远取诸物，于是始做八卦，以通神明之德，以类万物之情。”——《周易·系辞下》,"Anciently, when Bao-xi had come to the rule of all under heaven, looking up, he contemplated the brilliant forms exhibited in the sky, and looking down he surveyed the patterns shown on the earth. On this he devised the eight trigrams, to show fully the attributes of the spirit-like and intelligent (operations working secretly), and to classify the qualities of the myriads of things."
天使，堕落的天使。我们无法透过她美丽的脸庞察觉到她有何罪过。\n直到她展开她傲慢的、不羁的翅膀。,We can't detect her guilt through her beautiful face from a fallen angel. \nUntil she spread her Pride Wings.
人面对已知的危险也会克制不住自己的欲望，使潘多拉魔盒带来了许多苦难。\n但是人类仍在不断的打开一个个潘多拉魔盒，不过永远也别忘了那潘多拉魔盒里最后潜藏的希望。,"Even though humans know what dangers lie ahead, they still can't restrain their desires, hence a lot of suffering in the wake of opening Pandora's Boxes. \nHumans are still opening Pandora's Boxes one after another. But never forget the last hope hidden in Pandora's Boxes."
大自然的鬼斧神工下，诞生了这颗延续了代代华夏文明的星石。\n平静时躺匿于丛林山野，激烈时迸发出星光火花。\n它既文明的延续者，也是危险的终结者。,"Under the uncanny work of nature, this Starfire Stone has continued the Chinese civilization.\nLie down in the jungle and mountains when calm, and burst into starlight sparks when fierce. \nIt is both a continuation of civilization and a dangerous terminator."
单纯且强大——世界的真理也被这句话所概括。\n对冈格尼尔许下你的誓言，永不能反悔且毕将实现，对敌人时百发百中。\n投射时宛若流星划破天际，必将击穿一切，哪怕是圣剑格拉姆也难逃此劫。,"Simple and powerful-the truth of the world is also summed up by this sentence. \nMake your oath to Gangnir, never regret it and the oath will be fulfilled. You can use them to enemies when you are in fight.. \nWhen you are using it, it is like a meteor piercing the sky. It will penetrate everything even the Holy Sword Gram cannot escape this disaster."
幽冥神厄瑞玻斯是永久黑暗的化身，她用她的披风阻隔了人间与冥界。\n没有一丝丝的光能穿过幽冥披风到达厄瑞玻斯的地盘，永远的处于黑暗之中。,"The nether god Erebus is the embodiment of eternal darkness, and she uses her Nether Shawl to block the world and the underworld. \nNo trace of light can pass through the Nether Shawl  to reach the territory of Erebus, she is staying in darkness forever."
脚下踩着坚实的大地，耳边萦绕着城市的喧嚣，大家都生活在自己的忙忙碌碌中、计较着一件件鸡毛蒜皮的事。\n但宇宙的浩瀚也告诉我们谦卑，我们都生活在盖亚的俯视下，只不过在这个混沌的宇宙中我们是被盖亚偏爱的存在。,"Standing on the solid ground and surrouned by the hustle and bustle of the city, everyone is busy living their own life and worries about trivial things. \nBut the vastness of the universe humbles us. We all live under the eye of Gaia and we exist in this chaotic universe only because of Gaia's love for us."
四根天柱倾倒，九州大地毁裂，大火蔓延不熄，洪水泛滥不止。\n平凡的人类已经失去了生活的希望，是女娲用炼出的五色石补好了天空。\n正如我们的母亲一样，用着各式的五色石撑起了我们成长的天空。,"The four pillars fell and the land of earth was destroyed. Fire spread everywhere and floods crushed houses.\nHumans have lost the hope for their lives. Nuwa who mended the sky with the five-color stone. \nJust like her mother, she used all kinds of five-color stones to prop up the sky of our growth."
伊邪那美虽与天照大神难有缘分，但却也产生了无比的思恋。\n这份感情，浇灌在天照玩偶上，飘荡于高天原的一草一木之中。,"Although it is difficult for Izanami to have a relationship with the Amaterasu, she had an incomparable desire of it. \nThis feeling is watered on the Amaterasu's doll, floating among the plants and trees of the world."
垂死的勇士们接受了瓦尔基里的死亡之吻，被领向了英灵殿瓦尔哈拉。\n唯有勇敢的战死者能够到达梦想中的英灵殿，享受着白天战斗至死，夜晚复生宴饮的最美满的生活。\n英灵殿中都是能与诸神抗衡的英灵，当英灵殿的大门打开时，就准备接受你的挑战吧。,"The dying warriors accepted Valkyrie's death kiss and were led to Valhalla. \nOnly the brave death warriors can arrive to Valhalla in their dreams. Death warriors enjoying the most satisfying life of fighting during the day and resurrecting at night. \nThere are heroic spirits in the Valhalla that can contend with the gods. When the door of the Valhalla is open, be prepared to accept your challenge."
八尺琼勾玉能庇佑人们远离灾祸，让人们获得神力保佑。\n协调了万物生长，代表了日月光芒，为伊邪那岐所赐。,"Yasakani no Magatama can protect people from disasters and allow people to obtain divine blessings. \nCoordinates the growth of all things, represents the sun and the moon and is bestowed by Izanami."
阿努比斯的真理之秤落入了调皮的拉手中，而等待着亡者们的是一场奇妙的灵魂称量之旅。,Anubis's scale of truth fell into Ra's hands and the dead people will have a wonderful journey of their soul weighing.

是否想拥有至高无上的权利？\n是否想得到宙斯的尊敬？\n即使是短暂的犹豫，赫拉也不会允许。直到灰飞烟灭才罢休。,Do you want to have supreme rights? \nDo you want to be respected by Zeus? \nHera will destroy you without batting an eye if your answer is yes.
在这浪漫的夜晚，将爱情的祝福送给亲爱的你们\n丘比特正在用箭矢编织的一张只属于这对情侣的情网。,"On this romantic night, send the blessings of love to your dear\nCupid is using arrows to weave a loving line that belongs only to this couple."
在诸神的黄昏中，奥拉尔号角发出了最后的警告。\n既然没人能够逃掉，不如血战至最后一刻。\n海姆达尔最终与洛基展开了对决，也成为了最后倒下的神。,"As the twilight of the gods approached, the sound of Heimdall's Gjallarhorn gathered the Norse gods together for the final battle, Ragnarok.\nThere was no escape, so they fought to the very end. Heimdall fought Loki and was the last of the gods to fall."
混沌对于世界开端的描述真是再合适不过了。\n世界诞生于混沌，逐渐形成秩序，最终又归于混沌。\n没有人能够逃脱宇宙的法则，就像没有人能够逃脱卡俄斯的掌控。,"Chaos is the description of the beginning of the world.\nThe world was born in chaos, gradually formed order, and finally returned to chaos.\nNo one can escape the laws of the universe, just like no one can escape the control of Chaos."
青空下有一位少女在练习着剑法，时而心不在焉，时而心无旁骛。\n向着天空挥舞几刀，劈开心中的困惑，但少女的困惑又何止这一两点。,"Under the blue sky, there was a young girl practicing swordsmanship, sometimes absent-minded, and sometimes arrogant. \nWaving a few slashes towards the sky, split the confusion in happiness, but the girl's confusion is more than these."
命运的轮盘永远无法停止转动。\n命运因她的起伏不定，才显得更加迷人。正因为她的无法掌控，才值得去挑战。\n最终才明白，追逐自己命运的过程远比结果更加有趣。,"The destiny wheel can never stop spinning.\nDestiny is more fascinating because of its ups and downs. Because of the uncertainty, it is worth the challenge.\nIt finally realized that the process of chasing destiny is far more interesting than the result."
远离了天空烦闷，远离了地表的喧闹。\n冰龙静静的卧在深邃的冰窟中。\n这寂静，让思想变得更加深沉，赋予了冰枪幻想的力量。,"Away from the boredom of the sky, away from the noise on the ground. \nThe frost dragon is lying quietly in the deeping ice cave. \nThis silence makes the mind deeper and gives the ice spear the power of fantasy."
雨下大了，你在担心一把伞是否不够，怕她淋湿。\n缘结神可不建议，一把缘结伞足够。\n这是属于爱情的雨。搂住她，让彼此靠得更近。,"It's raining heavily, and you are worried about whether or not an umbrella will be enough to keep her from getting wet.\nEnmusubi disagrees, a fate umbrella is enough. This is the rain of love. Rain is hugging her to bring each other closer."
圣诞女神发出了疑问，到底什么是惊喜。\n圣诞女神盯着手中的花环思索着，貌似发现了一个全新的花草世界一般兴奋了起来。\n她仍在思索着，去找寻一个没有答案的答案。,"The Xmas Angel ask about what the surprise is? \nThe Xmas Angel stared at the wreath in her hand and thought, she seemed to be excited when she discovered a new world of flowers and plants. \nShe is still thinking, looking for an answer forever."
虽然哈迪斯有很多面纱，但这件在其中也属于比较特殊的。\n难道是因为面纱本身？不不不，而是送给我面纱的人赋予了此面纱独特的意义。,"Hades has many veils, one of those veils is really special. \nIs it because of the veil itself? No,the person who gave me the veil gave it a unique meaning."
没有人能逃避他的审判，即使你是地狱之王也不行。\n四十九年，即使时间比这更长，米迦勒也不会放弃对黑暗的审判。,"No one can escape her judgment, even if you are the king of hell. \nAfter forty-nine years, even the time is longer than this, Michael will not give up the trial of darkness."
因{SKILL_NAME}效果，{TARGET_NAME}被【燃烧】，每回合损失6%生命，持续4回合。,"Because of {SKILL_NAME}. {TARGET_NAME} is [Ignite], losing 6% of life per round for 4 rounds."

限定专属：风暴之龙,Exclusive Limited: Storm Dragon
据说，灰烬龙女也是一位爱干净的女孩子。\n的确如此，处理敌人剩下的灰尘往往是更加简单的事情。\n只是又要麻烦风暴龙女了，怪不好意思的。,"It is said that the Ember Dragon is a girl who loves cleanliness. \nIt is true, she always easier to deal with the dust left by the enemy. \nIt's just that she is going to trouble the Storm Dragon again to clean the dust."
风暴龙女时而也喜欢为春天送来一阵复苏的暖风，为干渴的大地送去及时的暴雨。\n但是你要是敢亵渎自然，龙女会让你感受最原始的恐怖。,"The Storm Dragon sometimes likes to send a resurgent warm breeze to Spring and send rainstorms to the thirsty land in time. \nBut if you are daring to blaspheme nature, the Storm Dragon will make you feel the most primitive horror."

But this claim had no actual basis, and her life experience has always been a mystery."

她原本是极为普通的妖怪，不知为何拥有了强大的神格。虽然力量惊人，但性格却意外地天真。\n猫又大多生于怨恨，但据她所言自己升格为神明前的主人是一位温柔正直的人类，所以她的力量更多源于爱与善念。,"She was a very ordinary monster originally, but for some reason she possessed a powerful godhead. Although the power is amazing,  her character is surprisingly naive. \nNekomata are mostly born by resentment. But according to her saying that the owner before she was promoted to a god was a gentle and upright human shows her power comes more from love and kindness."
她是北欧神话中爱情、战争与魔法之神，同时也是生育与丰饶之神。\n她性情温和而仁慈，美貌更是在众多北欧神明中首屈一指。但她也经常作为女武神的统率者，奔走于北欧各大战场，为英灵殿挑选英勇的战士。,"In Norse mythology, she is a goddess associated with love, war, magic and fertility. \nShe is gentle and kind, and her beauty is second to none among the Nordic gods. Often, as the leader of war goddesses, she chooses brave warriors for Valhalla in various Nordic war battlefields."

第七神域，创世神力量失控而诞生的错乱空间……,Seventh domain is a space created by the power which the creator lost control......
强大的英雄会被召唤至此，在神话中的伟大战场上争夺荣耀。,Powerful heroes will be called here to fight for glory on the great battlefield in the myth.
在战斗开始前调整好布阵策略，让强大的女神冲锋陷阵吧！,"Adjust the deployment strategy before the battle begins, and let the powerful angels head into battle!"
由于创世神更青睐依靠自身强大的力量，而取得的胜利。,Because the creator preferred to rely on his own tremendous strength to achieve victory.
因此，女神只能身着创世神意志所幻化的装备“天赐神装”。,"Therefore, angels can only equip the Blessing Outfit which is transformed by the will of the creator."
神装包含统一的装备、宝石、神器和内饰，是公正与勇气的象征。,"The blessing outfit contains uniform gears, gems, artifacts and attires, and is a symbol of justice and courage."

她原本并非大和神话中的传统神明，但源自于人类对她的信仰和崇拜，使得她具有了强大的神格与力量。\n她的诞生与过往一直是个迷，但她始终以自己的力量协调着人类与自然神明、妖怪之间的关系。,"Originally, She was not a traditional god in Yamato mythology. But derived from the belief and worship of mankind to her, she has a strong godhead and power. \nHer birth and past have always been a mystery, but she has always coordinated the relationship between humans, natural gods and monsters with her own power."
传闻她自月亮而来，因不明原因被贬入凡间，从所具备的神格看，她确实拥有凡人所不能及的强大神力。\n虽然外表看上去性情温和，但由于拥有聪慧的头脑和不爱见外人的羞怯性格，反而为她增加了一丝神秘感。,"It is said that she came from the moon and was demoted to the mortal world for unknown reasons. From the godhead she possesses, she does possess a powerful divine power beyond the reach of mortals. \nAlthough she looks mild, she has a bright mind and a shy personality, which adds a touch of mystery to her."

姐姐，你的表情很欠揍啊，我猜你是来找我们打架的吧？,"Hey sister, your face looks like you deserve to get your teeth kicked in. I guess you come for fighting, is it?"
我以为你在这个世界苏醒后能安分些，不过看来我想多了。,"I thought you would put in your place after waking up in this world, but it seems I'm wrong."
嗯？等等……看上去……姐姐你觉醒了全新的力量？,"Er? Wait... It looks like... Sister, you have awakened a new power?"
的确如此，但我还不清楚这力量究竟有多强大。,"It is true, but I still don't know how powerful this power is."
等你被两个妹妹痛揍一顿后就知道啦！！,You'll know when you are beaten up by your two little sisters! !
哎哟……我知道错了，能不能把我们从冰里面放出来……？,"Ouch...I know I was wrong, can you release me from the ice...?"
真是惊人，我有时间一定要好好研究这力量的来源……,It's amazing. I must study the source of this power when I have time...
我可以感受到，这并非此力量的极限……,I can feel that this is not the limit of this power...
我也这么认为，姐姐你需要找其他神明试试。,"I think so too, sister. You need to find other gods to try."
我想到几个合适的家伙了……,I thought of a few right guys...
啊啦……亲爱的，我以为你冻在冰海里醒不过来了。,"Oh, my dear, I thought you couldn't wake up in the ice sea."
你的冷笑话已经块让我犯困了，我可不是来听你说这些的。,Your lame jokes have already made me boring. I am not here to hear these.
有什么事吗？难不成是有喜欢的人，想让我帮你射一箭？,What's up? I guess you have someone you like and want me to shoot an arrow for you?
还是说，是来找我寻求永生之法的？,Or you came to learn ways to live forever?
不，我只不过想试一下自己觉醒的新力量而已。,"No, I just want to try my new awakening power ."
呵……即使曾经不分胜负，但现在我们确实不是你的对手。,"Mm...Although we ended in a draw in the past, for now, we indeed can not win."
阿嚏！这力量仿佛能把埃及炽热的沙漠，变成冰原一般……,Ahchoo! This power seems to be able to turn the hot desert of Egypt into an ice field...
于是我们的冰山美人，准备用这强大的神力做什么坏事呢？,"So our icy beauty, what bad things are you going to do, by this powerful divine power?"
我也不知道，我头一次感受到比寒冰还冷漠的空虚感……,"I don’t know. For the first time, I felt a sense of emptiness more indifferent than Frost..."
从爱情的命运来看，你或许该去问问帮你觉醒的那个人类。,"From the fate of love, perhaps you should ask the human who helped you awaken."

人类经历了这么多的挫折和背叛，我不知道他们是否还相信爱情。,Human beings have gone through so many frustrations and betrayals. I don't know if they still believe in love.
即使身份有别，凡人与神明也应当拥有相爱的权力！,"Even if their identities are different, mortals and gods should have the right to love each other!"
嘻嘻……你有喜欢的女孩子吗？要不要给她一箭，让她也喜欢上你？,Ha-ha! Do you have a preferred girl? Do you want to give her an arrow to make her love you too?
人类好像总以为靠权力或金钱就能得到一切，遗憾的是爱情并非如此。,"It seems that Humans always think that everything can be obtained by power or money. Unfortunately, love is not the case."
你射箭的水准如何？,How good is your archery?
作为爱神也挺无聊的，我也想来一场令人难忘的约会啊！,Being a god of love is also quite boring. I also want to have an unforgettable date!
我很喜欢百合这种花，世间再无比它更能象征纯洁和忠贞的存在了。,I like lilies very much. It can symbolize purity and loyalty more than ever in the world.
我听预言说，将来我会嫁给一个非常强大但也非常花心的家伙？,"I heard the prophecy that in the future, I will marry a very powerful guy who is also a playboy?"
想参观我的后花园么？就算世界末日降临，我也有一片自己的安静之地呢。,"Want to visit my back garden? Even if the end of the world comes, I have a quiet place of my own."
呵呵……花朵在战火燃烧的映衬下……才显得格外地有魅力呐。,Haha... the flowers seem to be extraordinarily attractive only under the flames of war.
自从我失去神力和记忆后，仿佛全世界都不在意我了一般。,"Since I lost my divine power and memory, it seems that the whole world doesn't care about me anymore."
我以为凡人的力量不过是渺小的存在，但事实证明，要战胜他们并非易事。,"I think the power of mortals is nothing but a small existence, but facts have proved that it is not easy to defeat them."
我依旧对飞翔有所恐惧，或许我应当放弃使用这双翅膀？,"I still have a fear of flying, maybe I should give up using these wings?"
人们常说无知者无畏，你觉得因为无知产生的勇敢有意义吗？,People often say that ignorant people are fearless. Do you think the bravery that comes from ignorance makes sense?
真理是一种奇特的存在……你知道自己永远无法理解，却还会坚定地追求它。,"Truth is a peculiar existence... You know you will never understand, but you will pursue it firmly."
美妙的艺术总是伴随着伟大的想象和创造，你不这么觉得吗？,"Wonderful art is always accompanied by great imagination and creation, don't you think so?"
雕塑创作是我最感兴趣的事，不管你心情如何，它总能让你平静下来。,"Sculpture creation is what I am most interested in. No matter what your mood is, it will always calm you down."
我始终想不通，人类与神明到底有什么不同……,I still can't figure out what is the difference between humans and gods...
你喜欢下雪的冬季吗？,Do you like snowy winter?
我曾经在自己的巢穴里度过了漫长岁月，没人能体会那种孤独感……,"I used to spend a long time in my lair, and no one can understand that feeling of loneliness..."
我不认同战争，因为战争总会给这个世界带来无休止的灾难……,"I don't agree with war, because war will always bring endless disasters to this world..."
想了解我同族的姐妹吗？她们似乎也随着这场灾难苏醒了呢……,Want to know my sisters of the same race? They seem to have awakened in this disaster.
人类都渴求如同神明一样永恒的生命，这其实并不难做到，想试试吗？,Humans are eager for eternal life like gods. This is actually not difficult to do. Do you want to try it?
大多数人类，都认为我只是个冰冷而无情的存在，你也这么想吗？,Most humans think that I am just a cold and merciless god. Do you think so too?
哟……你挺闲的嘛，有没有兴趣陪寂寞的女士度过漫漫长夜？,You are quite free. Are you interested in spending a long night with a lonely lady?
一个人说的话是谎言还是真实，真的那么重要吗？,Is it really that important whether what a person says is a lie or truth?
你更喜欢白天还是黑夜？,Do you prefer day or night?
人类纠结所行之事的善恶，在我看来其实意义并不大，你觉得呢？,"In my opinion, human beings are often confused in what they did is good or evil, in fact that is not meaningful. What do you think about it?"
你在处理各种麻烦的时候，更依赖直觉的判断，还是更相信理智的分析？,"When dealing with all kinds of troubles, do you rely more on intuitive judgment or rational analysis?"
电影真是人类文明的伟大产物，你爱看电影吗？更偏爱喜剧还是悲剧？,"Movies are really a great product from human civilization. Do you love watching movies? Which do you prefer, comedy or tragedy?"
今晚月色挺美的，不是吗？,"The moonlight is pretty tonight, isn't it?"
我并不会畏惧这场战争，我希望和你一起亲手结束它。,"I am not afraid of this war, I hope to end it with you."
我很喜欢兔子这种温顺的动物，你呢？,"I like gentle animals like rabbits very much, how about you?"
如果有一天……我必须要回到月亮上去，你愿意与我同行么？,"If one day, I have to go back to the moon, would you like to go with me?"
我其实并不想成为神明般的存在，永恒的生命对于我而言太沉重了……,"I actually don't want to be a god, because eternal life is too heavy for me..."
无聊而冷清的夜晚呢，过去我感到孤独时，总会唱一曲童谣解解闷。,"It's a boring and deserted night. When I was lonely in the past, I would always sing a nursery rhyme to relieve boredom."
从战场的号角声中，你能听到什么？,What do the battlefield horns inspire?
只要我没倒下，敌人就永远无法踏入城门。,"As long as I can fight, the enemy will never set foot inside the city gate."
不管是谁，都会有自己想守护的人存在。,There is always someone we want to protect. This is true for everyone.
听过诸神的黄昏么？,Have you heard of Ragnarok?
之前的战斗你差点没命！怎么可以这么莽撞！,You almost died in the previous battle! How can you be so reckless!
我丢失的神力恐怕难以恢复了……,I'm afraid it will be difficult to recover the divine power I lost...
作为统治者你太年轻了！你需要不顾一切让自己积累经验，并尽快成熟起来！,You are too young as a ruler! You need to become desperate to accumulate experience and mature as soon as possible!
我从来不认为神与人有什么差别，神明不过是强大的人类罢了！,I never think there is any difference between gods and mortals. Gods are just powerful humans!
战争是一种荣耀，我丝毫不畏惧战争，也不否认战争的重要性！,"War is a kind of glory. I am not afraid of war at all, nor do I deny the importance of war!"
嗯……你会觉得一名巫女穿上武士的装束很奇怪吗？,Do you think it's weird for a witch to wear a samurai costume?
自从转生在这个世界后，我无时不刻都在想着有朝一日能重新光复邪马台……,"Ever since I was reincarnated in this world, I have been thinking all the time that one day I can restore Yamatai..."
你……会觉得我太严肃而不像一个女孩子么……,Do you think I am too serious and not like a girl...
越是强大的力量，就越是危险，风暴也是如此……,"The more powerful the force, the more dangerous it is, and so is the storm..."
只有智慧能够掌控强大的力量，而非愤怒，你认为呢？,"Only wisdom can control powerful forces, not anger. How do you think of it?"
战争简直无聊透顶，有这些打打杀杀的时间，不如拿来好好做研究。,"The war is simply boring. With the time for fighting and killing, it is better to study others."
我同族的两个姐妹似乎也随着这场灾难苏醒了呢……虽然也在我的意料之中……,Two sisters of my family seem to have awakened with this disaster...Although it was also in my expectation...
人类和神明为什么都这么喜欢纠结自己的身份……神和人在我看来毫无区别。,Why do humans and gods like to entangle their identities so much... Gods and humans are indistinguishable from me.
虽然我把你当作竞争对手，但不得不承认，我对你还挺有好感……,"Although I regard you as a competitor, I have to admit that I have a good impression of you..."
啊……真是无聊！！真想找一个强者打一架！！,Ah...it's so boring! ! I really want to find a strong one to fight! !
你问我遇到敌人会怎么做？当然是先劝他投降！不投降就把他烤了！,"Are you asking about what I would do when I met an enemy? Of course, first persuade him to surrender! Roast him without surrendering!"
战争和一场游戏没什么差别，无非是谁先出局而已，你觉得呢？,"War is no different from a game. It's just who gets out first, what do you think?"
嗯……我察觉到两位姐妹和我一样，也苏醒在这个世界了呐……,"Hmm... I noticed that the two sisters, just like me, have also awakened in this world..."
神之所以为神，并非力量强大，而是在战场上有过人的勇气和赴死的决心！,"The reason why God owns the place not because he is powerful, but he has extraordinary courage and determination to die on the battlefield!"
人类的料理真是有意思，我开始理解“文明始于火焰”这句话的含义了。,Human cooking is really interesting. I have begun to understand the meaning of the phrase civilization begins with flames.
看来即使我倾尽全力，也难以让这个世界的太阳重新焕发光辉……,"It seems that even if I spared no effort, it is still difficult to make the sun of this world shine again..."
我时常回忆起过去在高天原的日子，虽然麻烦不断，但却充实无比。,"I often recalled the days when I was in Takamagahara. Although there were constant troubles, they enriched my life."
为什么人们必须用战争的方式来解决问题和矛盾，这难道不会让事情更糟吗？,Why do people have to use war to solve problems and contradictions? Doesn't this make the matter worse?
度过这场灾难之后，我一定要重振大和神明曾经的辉煌，为神系间带来和平！,"After going through this disaster, I must revive the former glory of Yamato god pedigree and bring peace to the gods!"
你的衣服在战斗中损坏得好厉害啊……需要我帮你做一件新的吗？,Your clothes were damaged badly in the battle... Do you want me to make you a new one?
凡人们始终畏惧死亡，在我看来死亡意味着脱离情感的宁静与永恒之美……,"Mortal people always fear death. In my opinion, death means tranquility free from emotion and eternal beauty..."
神又如何，人又如何，不都要面对毁灭与消逝的命运么……,"Whoever it is, it is god or mortal, everyone needs to face the fate of destruction and vanishing..."
为何人们总把我的战略蔑称为“阴谋”，战斗的计谋难道还有善恶之分吗？,Why do people always call my strategy a conspiracy? Is there any difference between good and evil in fighting strategies?
我从来不否认自己是个野心家，这个乱糟糟的世界太需要秩序和统一了！,I never deny that I am a careerist. This messy world is so in need of order and unity!

毫无疑问是你。,"Undoubtedly, you are stronger."
呃，我不想回答……,"Uh, I don't want to answer..."
这么神奇么？,"Wow, is that true?"
总感觉不是这样……,I think it isn't that...
令人振奋的回答呢！爱情不正是因为重重磨难而显得珍贵吗？,Good answer! Doesn't love appear precious because of many hardships?
没必要用那么沉重的语气回答我！有我在的话，至少你不会在爱情的问题上倒霉。,"There is no need to answer me in such a heavy tone! Because I'm here, at least you won't be unlucky on the issue of love."
就是说嘛 ！如果神与人的身份会阻止伟大的爱情，我宁愿不当神明了！,"Exactly! If the identity of gods and humans will prevent great love, I would rather not be a god!"
唉……或许你是正确的吧，毕竟这样的爱情终将随着人类短暂的生命而消逝。,"Well, perhaps you are right. After all, this kind of love will eventually disappear with the short life of mankind."
啊啦……你要是不告诉我，我就把你的名字写在箭上，闭着眼睛射出去啦！,"Aah, if you don't tell me, I will write your name on the arrow and shoot it out with my eyes closed!"
那么你想给哪个幸运的女孩子来一箭呢？等等？！你为什么要把箭对着我？！,"So which lucky girl do you want to give an arrow? Wait, why is the arrow pointing at me?!"
所以你永远会和我一起，去击碎那些虚伪的爱情，对吧？！,"So you will always be with me to crush those false love, right? !"
当你遇到连统治世界这样的权力，也肯为她而放弃的女孩子后，你就明白了。,"When you meet a girl who will make you be willing to give up even the power to rule the world, you will understand that."
真的？！那太好了！我最近当爱神有些倦怠了，正想找个人替我一阵子呢！,"Really? That's great! I'm a bit tired of being a god of love recently, and I'm looking for someone to replace me for a while!"
要我亲自来教你吗？抓住我的手慢慢拉开弓……哎呀，你在碰哪儿呢！,"Do you want me to teach you in person? Grab my hand and slowly pull the bow away...Oh, where are you touching!"
哎呀……你……你怎么这么突然……我一点心理准备都没做好……,"Oh, why you so suddenly ask me? I'm not mentally prepared at all..."
谁……谁都行……我的意思是 ……和你约会也是可以的哦……,"Anyone is ok...I mean, it's okay to date with you..."
本……本来就是这样！就算你话说得再好听，我也不会对凡人的赞美感到欣喜的！,"That's just the way it is! No matter how pleasant your words are, I won't be happy with the praise from mortals!"
和那些喜爱拥有惊艳花色的人不同……你倒是挺让我感到意外的。,"You are different from those who love flowers with beautiful colors, which surprised me a lot.."
看来你是个不相信命运的人呢，很久没有凡人敢于对抗命运了……,It seems that you are a person who does not believe in fate. It has been a long time since no mortal dared to fight against fate.
那个人最好别是你，不然你可就有苦头要吃了……呵呵……,"You'd better wish that person is not you, otherwise you will have to suffer a lot in the future."
这里又没有其他人，没必要这么拘谨地回应我啦……,"There is no one else here, you don't need to feel stiff to respond to me."
虽然只有我们两人！但这只是个私人的邀请罢了！不要多想！,"Although there are only two of us! But this is just a personal invitation, don't think too much!"
哼，战场上我从不手软，但你若希望我仁慈对待敌人，我……我也并不反对就是……,"I'm never soft on the battlefield. But if you want me to treat the enemy with kindness, I don't object to it."
呵呵……已经有很多人和我说过这句话，并跟随我上战场了，想知道他们的故事吗？,Haha... Many people have already said this to me and followed me on the battlefield. Would you like to know their stories?
你说……说什么呢！我……我可不在乎一个凡人对我的仰慕！,What are you talking about! I don't ...don't care what a mortal admires for me!
呵呵……是啊，这个世界看重的是力量，在此之前，你愿意成为我的剑与盾吗？,"Haha...Yes, what this world prizes ​​is power. Before that, would you be willing to be my sword and shield?"
你……你和其他人不同！你可是我亲自挑选的，亲自认可的人！,You are different from everyone else! You are the one I personally selected and personally recognized!
神明向来各自为战，但你却能让敌对的神明团结起来，这也是我感到惊讶的。,"The gods always fight in their own way, but you can unite the opposing gods, which is also a surprise to me."
你说的没错，我会重新让自己摆脱恐惧的，向往自由的心比什么都最重要。,"You are right, I will get rid of my fear again. The desire to be free is more important than anything else."
虽然有些不甘心，但每次见到你的时候，能否飞翔仿佛也变得不再重要了……,"Although a little unwilling, every time I see you, it doesn't seem to matter whether I can fly or not..."
我也这么觉得，战场上的英雄如果知道他可能失败，那么他是无法冲锋陷阵的。,"I think so. If a hero knows that he might fail in the battlefield, then he cannot charge."
有些时候的确如此，而且这种鲁莽所带来的代价也是沉重的……,"Sometimes this is true, and the cost of such recklessness is also heavy."
我一直认为自己是个勇敢的人，但谨慎地思考问题好像不是我的长处……,"I have always considered myself a brave person, but it seems that it is not my advantage to think carefully about problems..."
有些事情，想的越多反而越让人感到迷茫，简单地思考其实也不错。,"For some things, the more you think about it, the more confused you will be. It is also good to simply think about it."
所以优秀的艺术家也应该是优秀的发明家，成为这样的人一直是我的理想呢！,"Therefore, a good artist should also be a good inventor. I always dream to be such a person!"
我这双人造的翅膀就是一件奇特的发明！它难道不是艺术与创造的完美结合吗？,My artificial wings are a peculiar invention! Isn't it a perfect combination of art and creation?
我的作品都是以自己为原型的人体艺术……但是给你看的话……我倒也不介意……,"My works are all body art based on myself...But if it is you, I don't mind showing you that."
雕塑只能自己感悟啦，不过如果你有兴趣的话，我很乐意当你的模特！,"Sculpture can only be understood by yourself, but if you are interested, I would be happy to be your model!"
未必，我在希腊见过很多人类英雄，他们完全有能力在战场上和神明一较高下！,"Not necessarily, I have seen many human heroes in Greece. They are fully strong enough to compete with gods on the battlefield!"
有很多妖怪或是魔物也具有接近永恒的生命……可它们好像也不算是神……,"There are many monsters and demons whose lifespan close to eternity, but they don't seem to be gods either."
寒冷往往能带给智者们冷静和理性的心，我很欣慰你能喜欢这个季节。,Cold can often bring calm and rational hearts to the wise. I am very pleased that you can like this season.
虽然人们往往把寒冷和死亡想到一起，但冰雪在世界万物中，却是永恒的象征……,"Although people often think of cold and death together, ice and snow are eternal symbols in the world..."
很多伟大的人类英雄都是如此，他们簇拥无数的荣耀 ，但却从不被他人理解。,"Many great human heroes have faced like this. They are surrounded by countless glory, but they are never understood by others."
我从没想过自己会对一个人类感兴趣，不过和你相处的日子好像也挺有意思……,"I never thought I would be interested in a human being, but the days with you seem to be quite interesting."
很庆幸你也这么想，这个世界需要的是理性和秩序，而非混乱和破坏。,"Fortunately you think so. What the world needs is rationality and order, not chaos and destruction."
但大多数的原因都很无理，我希望你能和我一样，冷静思考每一次战斗的意义。,But most of the reasons are unreasonable. I hope you can calmly think about the meaning of every battle like me.
她是我们三姐妹中脾气最糟的，性子很急但处事热情爽快，但和人类的关系还不错。,"She is the worst-tempered of our three sisters. She is very anxious but enthusiastic and refreshing, and she has a good relationship with humans."
他是我们三姐妹中头脑最好的，曾有很多赏金猎人去讨伐她，但一个都没回来过……,"She has the brightest mind of our three sisters. There have been many bounty hunters to fight against her, but none of them have come back..."
方法很简单，把你冰冻起来，你就能和我一样拥有永恒的青春了，这不是很美妙么？,"The method is very simple. Freeze yourself, then you can have eternal youth like me. Isn't this wonderful?"
明智的决定，人类或许能获得永恒的生命，但却可能为此付出更大的代价……,"Wise decision. Mankind may be able to obtain eternal life, but it may pay a greater price for it..."
奇怪的家伙呐……或许这也是为什么我愿意在你面前敞开心扉的原因吧……,Strange guy... Maybe this is why I am willing to open my heart in front of you...
我不知道……但至今为止，没有人会像你这样无时不刻地陪伴我……,"I don't know...but so far, no one will accompany me like you all the time..."
啊啦！真是个坦率的家伙呢！希望今晚我们能有个愉快的回忆。,Oh! What a frank guy! Hope we can have a pleasant memory tonight.
喔？让我猜猜……难道是要去见其他的女孩子？,"Well, let me guess... Are you going to meet other girls?"
可惜的是我自创世之初到现在为止，并没有见过多少人类愿意说真话……,It's a pity that I haven't seen many human beings willing to tell the truth from the beginning of my creation until now...
呵呵……是吗？那么猜猜看，我现在说的这句“我爱你”是真的还是假的？,"Oh, really? Then guess, I am saying I love you, is that truth or a lie?"
作为神明，我挺羡慕人类能享受在午后的太阳下，和恋人逛街约会的时光。,"As a god, I am quite envious that humans can enjoy the time shopping and dating with lovers in the afternoon sun."
黑夜总是充满神秘和暧昧的气氛，很适合二人独处呢……话说回来，你今晚有空吗？,"The night is always full of mystery and an ambiguous atmosphere, which is quite suitable for two to be alone… Anyway, are you free tonight?"
有意思，那么就让我看看你的善良是否真的能拯救这场灾难吧。,That's interesting. Then let me see if your kindness can really save this disaster.
我很欣慰你认识到了这一点，不管如何，我只喜欢强者……,"I'm very pleased that you realize this. Whatever happens, I only like the strong..."
啊啦！那么用你的直觉猜猜看，今晚你和我在房间里会发生点啥“麻烦”呢？,"Well, then use your instinct to guess, what trouble will happen to you and me in the room tonight?"
呵呵……是个冷静的家伙，不过在我的魅力下，你的冷静又能坚持多久呢……,"Haha! You are a calm guy, but under my charm, how long can you stay calm..."
意料之内的答案呢，现实中的悲剧已经够多了，希望你能为这场灾难带来转机……,The answer is to be expected. There are enough tragedies in reality. I hope you can bring a turn for this disaster...
真是出乎我的意料，我可不希望你变成一个性格悲观灰暗的家伙！,"What a surprise, I don't want you to become a pessimistic guy!"
从今往后我都会怀念今天和你一起看过的月亮，希望你也不要忘却今日的约定……,"From now on I will miss the moon that we saw today, and I hope you will not forget today's promise..."
你没有必要这么快给我答复……我会一直等，直到你完成自己的使命后……,You don't need to answer me so quickly. I will wait until you complete your mission.
感谢你一直以来对我的信任，我会在最激烈的战场上保护好你的身后。,"Thank you for your trust in me all the time, and I will protect your back on the deadly battlefield."
那么请至少允许我在战争结束前，每晚向月亮祈求你的平安。,Then at least allow me to pray to the moon for your safety every night before the war is over.
它们非常喜欢和人类亲近，是一群很讨人喜爱的家伙呢……,They like to get close to humans very much. They are so lovable guys...
嗯……以你的性格，或许会更喜欢一些凶猛而野性的家伙，我猜的没错吧？,"Hmm... With your personality, you might prefer some fierce and wild guys, right?"
等这场战争结束后，我们便一起回我的故乡吧，那里永远没有末日和灾难。,"After this war is over, let's go back to my hometown together, where there will never be apocalypse and disaster."
我明白……你在这个世界上，或许有永远也不能舍弃的事物吧……,"I understand that you are in this world, maybe there are things you can never give up..."
我应该感谢能够与你相遇，这或许是命运给我这个孤独的人最大的安慰了。,I should be grateful for meeting you. Maybe this is the greatest comfort that fate has given a lonely person.
凡人们叹息短暂的生命，但他们又怎么会明白永恒的寂寞……,Mortal people sigh for the short life. How can they understand the eternal loneliness...
那么在我的膝上躺下，闭上你的眼睛静静地听吧，祝你一夜好梦……,"Then lie down on my lap, close your eyes and listen quietly. Wish you a good night..."
嗯，如果是你的话，我很乐意……,"Well, if it were you, I would be happy to listen."
呵……下次让我看看你在战场上的勇猛吧。,"Well, next time show me your bravery on the battlefield."
当你的家园被入侵时，你会明白这种感受的。,Only those who have had their homeland invaded would understand.
哼……你确实也是个能让人安心的家伙……,You are very reassuring.
至今为止，我从未让北欧的同伴们失望过。,"So far, I have never let my Nordic companions down."
我拒绝回答，但……但以后你会知道的……,"I refuse to answer, but... you will know in the future…"
那……那你呢？你希望守护的人是谁？,"Then, what about you? Who do you want to protect?"
我发誓……绝不会让这种事再次发生在这个世界。,I swear... Never let this happen again in this world.
也好，你不会想知道那场灾难有多惨烈……,"Well, that's ok, you don't want to know how tragic the disaster was..."
我……我才没担心！我只是……只是随便说说罢了！,I wasn't worried. I was just... pointing it out.
下次如果没有我的保护，不要再这样冒险了！,"If you don't have my protection next time, then don't take risks like that again!"
你的意思是……你愿意和我一起找回我的力量吗？,What do you mean... Are you willing to regain my strength with me?
笨蛋……,You fool...
不错的意志！你让我看到了我年轻时的影子……,Nice will! You let me see my old time when I was young...
看来你不像我一样是个急性子的家伙，或许你比我更适合当一个统帅。,"It seems that you are not a short temper guy like me, maybe you are more suitable to be a commander than me."
所以人类只要不断地磨练自己，终有一天能够达到神明的强大境界！,"Therefore, as long as human beings continuously hone themselves, one day they will be able to reach the mighty state of gods!"
即使是永恒的生命，人类也能够通过魔法与神祈做到，我自己就是一个成功的例子！,"Even for eternal life, human beings can do it through magic and praying. I am a successful example of that!"
我宁愿在战场上为自己的理念而牺牲，人活着的意义不就是为了贯彻自己的理念吗？,I would rather sacrifice for my own ideas on the battlefield. Isn't the meaning of a person's life to implement their own ideas?
希望你也能够在战场上找到自己活着的意义和价值，并为自己的理念而战！,"I hope you can also find the meaning and value of your life on the battlefield, and fight for your own ideas!"
我也这么想，什么样的装束不是重点，关键是你是否具备巫女的智慧与武士的意志！,"I think so too. What kind of costume is not the point, the key is whether you have the wisdom of a witch and the will of a samurai!"
哼！很快我就会在战场上向你证明，我也是一名拥有不屈意志的合格武者！,"Well, soon I will prove to you on the battlefield that I am also a qualified warrior with an indomitable will!"
我就知道我可以信任你！我很期待你作为统治者的才能和勇气！,I knew I could trust you! I look forward to your talent and courage as a ruler!
如果是别人这样对我说，我绝不会认同，但不知为什么，我总觉得你说的没错……,"If someone else said to me like this, I would never agree. But I don't know why, I always think you're right..."
和我想的一样呢！就算女孩子也有坚强和威严的一面嘛！,Same as I thought! Even girls have a strong and commanding side!
在你的面前，我多多少少还是会在意一点的了……,"In front of you, I would care more about it..."
和大部分人类不同，你比我想象中更为理性，或许和你合作是一个正确的决定。,"Unlike most humans, you are more rational than I thought, and maybe it is a correct decision to cooperate with you."
是么？你是第147位说出这句话的人类，猜猜看前146个家伙的命运如何？,Really? You are the 147th human to say this. Guess the fate of the last 146 guys?
很欣慰听到你认同我的观点，或许你真的有能力成为众神的领导者。,"I am very pleased to hear that you agree with my point of view, maybe you really have the ability to become the leader of the gods."
愤怒只会让人头脑发热罢了，但如果能驾驭自己的愤怒，或许也能拥有强大的力量。,"Anger will only make your head hot, but if you can control your own anger, you may also have powerful power."
某种角度上你没说错，在击败来讨伐我的那群笨蛋后，我的力量确实提升了不少。,"In a way, you are right. After defeating the group of idiots who came to crusade against me, my strength has indeed improved a lot."
所以你还需要多长时间，才能结束这场神明间的世界大战？,So how long will it take you to end this world war between the gods?
这个脾气暴躁的家伙醒过来可不是什么好事，意外的是她和人类相处得还不错……,"It's not a good thing for this grumpy guy to wake up. Surprisingly, she gets along well with humans..."
你没事最好别去惹她，她要是心情不好，你可能就要被冻在冰块里度过余生了……,"If you're fine, don't mess with her. If she is in a bad mood, you may be frozen in ice for the rest of your life..."
神也有诞生和毁灭，也需要遵循世间的规则，神并非真理，只是很强的存在罢了。,"God also has birth and destruction, and he also needs to follow the rules of the world. God is not the truth, but just a strong existence."
在我观念中，只有想成为神的人才会这么说，看来你也是个有野心的家伙呢……,"In my opinion, only those who want to become gods would say this. It seems that you are also an ambitious guy..."
除了竞争对手外。我很期待和你之后的关系，那个……更深入一点的关系也可以……,"In addition to competitors. I am looking forward to the relationship with you in the future, that... a deeper relationship can also be..."
你太迟钝了！我们合作了这么久，你都没有察觉出来吗……,"You are too slow! We have been working together for so long, haven't you noticed it..."
没问题！这次我可不会像上回那样，因为大意输给你了！,"no problem! This time I won't be like the last time, because I lost to you carelessly!"
终于轮到我出场了吗？！等着看我把敌人烧成烤肉吧！哈哈哈！,Is it finally my turn to play? ! Wait to see me burn the enemy into a barbecue! Hahaha!
我看上去像是会手下留情的人吗？！没有比击败敌人更让我兴奋的了！,Do I look like a merciful person? ! Nothing excites me more than defeating an enemy!
就算是魔物，也要给一个和平解决问题的机会嘛，虽然大部分时候都没用就是了。,"Even if it is a monster, it must be given a chance to solve the problem peacefully, although it is useless most of the time."
作为你的同伴，我挺高兴听到你这个统帅认同我的看法，哼哼……,"As your companion, I am very happy to hear you, the commander-in-chief, agree with me, hum..."
没什么奇怪的，踏上这个世界的战场时，我早就没有任何对生命的留恋了。,"It's no surprise that when I stepped onto the battlefield of this world, I had no longer any nostalgia for life."
她是个满口智慧、战略的家伙，不过要真论打架的话，她肯定打不过我！,"She is a wise and strategic guy, but if you really want to fight, she will definitely not be able to beat me!"
那个冷冰冰的家伙太无趣了，在她身边我可一秒钟都呆不下去！,"That cold guy is so boring, I can't stay by her side for a second!"
所以，你作为众神的统帅，必须要具备比他们还强大的勇气！,"Therefore, as the commander of the gods, you must have courage stronger than them!"
想得太复杂反而没意义，没有勇气，你如何在成神的途中直面困难和恐惧？,"Thinking too complicated is meaningless. Without courage, how do you face the difficulties and fears on the way to becoming a god?"
没想到吧？！我的手艺可一点也不逊于你们人类的顶级厨师！,Didn't expect it? ! My craftsmanship is not inferior to your top human chefs!
嗯……我想想……大多数的料理我都喜欢，不过最喜欢的当然还是烤肉！！,"Hmm... let me think... I like most of the dishes, but of course, the roast meats are my favorite! !"
确实，自责没有任何意义，作为光明与希望的象征，我需要重新振作起来！,"Indeed. Self-blame has no significance. As a symbol of light and hope, I need to cheer up again!"
你说的没错……即使曾经身为太阳的主宰，现在也需要与同伴一起面对这世界末日。,"You are right...Even if you were once the ruler of the sun, you still need to face the end of the world with your companions."
抱歉，我似乎有些过度沉湎于以前的时光了，希望没有给你带来困扰。,"Sorry, I seem to be over-indulged in the passing time. I hope it didn't bother you."
如你所言，人们都期望找回过去的和平，我们必须终结这场灾难！,"As you said, people expect to find a peaceful life like in the past, so we must end this disaster!"
不管如何，我始终相信理念的差异可以通过和平，而非战争的方式得到统一。,"Anyway, I always believe that differences in ideas can be unified in a more peaceful way, not war."
我能理解危急关头需要立刻解决的困境，但我依旧希望你慎重对待任何一场战争。,"I can understand the dilemma that needs to be resolved immediately in a crisis, but I still hope that you treat every war with caution."
到那时，大和神明将承担起维护众神间和平的职责，世界将永远不再有矛盾和争执。,"At that time, the Yamato gods will take the responsibility of maintaining peace, so the re will be no disputes anymore."
但我一定会完成这个使命，你没感受到吗，命运让我降临在这个世界就是为此。,But I will definitely complete this mission. Do you feel it? That's why destiny made me come to this world.
虽然我和你所处的时代不同，但我对自己纺织和设计服装的技巧可是很有自信的！,"Although I live in a different era from you, I am very confident in my skills in spinning and designing clothes!"
虽然在帮您量身高和三围时……要麻烦您“坦诚相见”，但我们的关系应该无碍……,"Although when I measure your height and measurements, you need to be frank with me, I think our relationship should be fine for that..."
呵呵，当一个人连死亡也不再畏惧时，他将不再有任何弱点，你很快就会明白的……,"Haha, when a person feels no fear of death, he will no longer have any weaknesses. You will soon understand..."
你是我见到的最理性的凡人了，我们今后的合作或许会比较有趣……,You are the most rational mortal I have ever met. Our future cooperation may become more interesting...
所以无论人类或神明，都应在活着时遵循既定的命运，为自己的死亡做好准备……,"Therefore, no matter it is mortal or gods, they should follow fate while they are alive and prepare for death..."
喔？是吗？我很乐意看看作为死亡的代言人，你能不能逃得出我的手掌心……,"Oh, really? I would like to see if you, as the spokesperson of death, can escape from me..."
明智的回答，计谋就是计谋，善良与邪恶不过都是一种说辞和借口罢了。,"A wise answer. A strategy is just a strategy, to differ them as good or evil is just a kind of rhetoric and excuse."
看来和我不同，你更愿意用拳头和力量来解决矛盾……我该赞扬你的荣耀感么？,It seems that you are different from me. You are more willing to use your fists and strength to resolve conflicts... Should I praise your sense of glory?
你没说错，但遗憾的是，这句话只在这个强者活着的时候有效……,"You are right, but unfortunately, this sentence is only valid when the strong man is alive..."
啊，难以相信我会从凡人嘴里听到这话，没错，其实你会发现死亡是最公平的规则。,"Oh, it's hard to believe that I would hear this from mortals. That's right, you will find that death is the fairest rule in the world."
是啊……多少英雄们为荣耀而献出生命，这样迎来死亡倒也是一种艺术……,Yes...see how many heroes lost their lives for glory. Death in this way is also an art...
死亡会抹去一切，再伟大的英雄所创造的荣耀，也会随崇拜者的逝去而消散吧……,"Death will erase everything. Whatever how great the glory was made by the hero, it will fade away with the passing of admirers..."
从你的表情看来……是不是觉得人生中最大的遗憾是少了女孩子的陪伴？,Look at your reaction...do you think that the biggest regret in life is the lack of a girl's company?
啧啧……看看你身边那些对你崇拜到家的女孩子们，你的人生确实没什么遗憾的了。,"Well, look at the girls around you, see how they admire you. You really have no regrets in your life."
以你强大的战斗力，再危险的地方也能回来，当然，站着还是躺着另当别论……,"With your strong power, you will return from any dangerous place. Of course, it is another matter of which way you come back, whether it is standing or lying down..."
嗯……出发之前你最好穿上最厚的盔甲，不然我不保证你能“完整”地回来……,"Hmm... you'd better put on the thickest armor before you leave, otherwise I don't guarantee that you will come back completely..."
明智之举！当你死后接受我的审判时，我保证你会长个心眼……,"You made a sensible choice! When you go on my trial after you die, I promise you will know more..."
放心，比你想象中好玩得多……尤其是你亲自把讨厌的家伙踹下深渊的时候……,"Don't worry, it's much more fun than you think...especially when you kick the nasty guy down the abyss..."
我倒不反感战争，一场战争带来的亡者，能让我冷清的宫殿热闹好几个月……,I don't feel repulsion for war. The dead people caused by war can make my lonely palace bustling for months...
喔？我们打个赌吧，看看这场世界末日能不能结束于你所引导的战争。,"Well, let's make a bet and see if this doomsday can end with the war you lead."
啊啦，那今晚你有空么？有无兴趣来我的房间体验一下死神“有魅力”的一面……？,"Uh-hum, are you free tonight? Are you interested in experiencing the charming side of the god of death in my room?"
真是让我失望，看来今天晚上我有必要惩罚一下你这个不懂情调的家伙了……,It really disappoints me. It seems that I need to punish you tonight who doesn't understand the romance...
大自然有时候确实会带来灾难，但这是上天指示的命运，并非人为的灾祸。,"Nature does sometimes bring disasters, but this is a destiny directed by heaven, not a man-made disaster."
虽然你时常在战场上拼杀，但我很清楚，你所做的一切也是为了尽快终结战争。,"Although you often fight on the battlefield, I know that everything you do is to end the war as soon as possible."
希望你和女孩子相处的时候别太急躁，女孩子生气起来可比天漏了还可怕……,I hope you don't get too impatient when you get along with girls. Girls get angry even more terrible than the heaven cracks...
喔，是吗？那么你一定很擅长追女孩子了，和女孩子相处可需要不少耐心……,"Oh, is it? Then you must be very good at chasing girls. It takes a lot of patience to get along with girls..."
我很欣慰你能认同，万事万物都有既定的命运，而自然无时不刻掌控着它们。,"I am very pleased that you can agree. Everything has a destiny, and nature controls them all the time."
其他人我一定不觉得能成功，不过如果是你的话……或许有小小的可能性吧。,"I certainly don't think other people can succeed, but if it is you... maybe there is a small possibility."
你的好意我心领了，然而没有必要这样做，因为这是大自然要我面对的命运。,"I appreciate your kindness, but there is no need to do so, because this is the destiny that nature wants me to face."
嘻嘻……还从没有凡人对我说过这样的话……你知道这意味着什么吗？,Haha... No mortal has ever said something like this to me...Do you know what it means?
相信我，在经历了无数的冒险和刺激过后，你会觉得平淡的日子是一种享受的。,"Believe me, after experiencing countless adventures and excitement, you will feel that dull life is a kind of enjoyment."
你也这么认为吗？！今晚有没有兴趣来我的花园看看我亲手种植的盆栽？,Do you think so too?! Would you be interested in coming to my garden tonight to see the potted plants I plant?
哼……希望你确实能有这个觉悟，毕竟正义之举需要超凡的勇气。,"Humph... Hope you can really have this consciousness. After all, justice requires extraordinary courage."
勇气源自于你的理念，当你的理念坚不可摧时，战场上将没有敌人能够阻挡你。,"Courage comes from your consciousness. When your consciousness is unassailable, nothing can stop you on the battlefield."
我现在就可以送你去天堂，不过有去无回，想试试么？,"I can send you to heaven right now, but there is no return. Do you want to have a try?"
这我可不清楚，但从地狱硫磺火坑每天传出的惨叫声来看，应该是个挺刺激的地方。,"I don't know, but judging from the screams from the sulfur fiery pits of hell every day, it should be a very exciting place."
你觉得毁灭这个世界的真的是恶魔吗？还是潜藏在人或神心中的邪念呢？,Do you think it is really the devil who destroys this world? Or it is the evil thoughts hidden in the hearts of people or gods?
我也不知道，倒不如说我希望看到有一天你能解决这个问题。,"I don't know either, but I'd rather say that I hope you can solve this problem one day."
你在开玩笑么？！如果是真的话，我一定要给你几拳确认你不是在做梦！,"Are you kidding me? ! If it is true, I must give you a few punches to confirm that you are not dreaming!"
我很乐意找个唱诗班每天对她唱圣歌，唱上个几百年，直到她受不了认罪悔过为止。,"I would be happy to find a choir to sing hymns to her every day for hundreds of years, until she can't stand then pleads guilty and repents."
作为众神的统帅，果敢与理性缺一不可，但理性是一切正确判断的前提！,"As a commander of the gods, courage and rationality are all needed, but rationality is the prerequisite for all correct judgments!"
你……你要做什么？！周围的人……都在看着我们呐！再……再不放手我要生气了！,What... what are you going to do? ! The people around us.. They are watching us! I'm going to be angry if you don't let go!
所以，下一场战斗是什么时候？我很期待与强敌在战场上拼杀的时刻。,"So, when is the next battle? I am looking forward to fighting against powerful enemies on the battlefield."
一切荣耀归于英灵殿，希望在您的指挥下我们能够战无不胜！,All the glory belongs to Valhalla. We hope that we can be invincible under your command!
其实由于我体内集合了众多女武神们的灵魂，所以我能运用她们每个人的作战技巧。,"In fact, because I have gathered the souls of many Valkyries in my body, I can use the combat techniques of each of them."
没问题！以指挥官您的资质和悟性，学会这些技巧并不是什么难事！,"No problem! With you- commander's aptitude and perception, it is not difficult to master these skills!"
我也不清楚原因，但在顺应您的召唤而降临时，似乎所有的姐妹们都产生了共鸣。,"I don't know, but when I arrived in response to your summon, it seemed that all the sisters resonated."
当然会，但遇到争执的时候，我们会在冥想中打一架，谁赢了就听谁的。,"Of course we will, but when we encounter disputes, we will fight in meditation, and we will listen to whoever wins."
我们女武神是优秀的战士，但很可惜，我们并不是优秀的军师。,"Our Valkyries is an excellent warrior, but unfortunately we are not good military counsellors."
毋庸置疑，从我们之前胜利中，已经证明了您策略的合理性。,"Undoubtedly, from our previous victories, you have proven the rationality of your strategy."
是的！那是一座拥有无比魅力的壮观建筑，也是北欧所有女武神所在的圣殿。,"Yes! It is a spectacular building with great charming, and it is also the sanctuary of all the Nordic Valkyries."
是啊！如果想体验的话，可以今晚来我的房间……我保证您会喜欢上这段时光的……,"Yep! If you want to experience it, you can come to my room tonight...I promise you will enjoy..."
喔对了，打造的时间会有些漫长，你可能得耐着性子等上两三百年……,"Well, it may take a long time to craft, maybe for two or three hundred years..."
如果运气不好，神器会带有诅咒，不过放心，死不了人的，顶多让你做几天噩梦……,"If you are unlucky, the artifact may bring curses. But don't worry, it won't kill you. At most, you will have nightmares for a few days..."
但如果没有武器，善良之人又如何抵御邪恶的入侵呢？,"But if there are no weapons, how can a kind person resist the invasion of evil?"
或许你是对的，武器应当用于保卫家园，而非入侵和掠夺弱者。,"Perhaps you are right. Weapons should be used to defend our homeland, not to invade and pillage the weak."
和你勇猛善战的性格很像，兵贵神速，没有比快速突击敌方弱点更有效的战术了。,It is very similar to your brave and skillful character. Speed is precious in war. There is no more effective tactic than to quickly assault the enemies' weaknesses.
挺让我惊讶的，我一直没发现你射箭的水平有如此之高！,It surprised me. I never realized that your archery level is so high!
我可以自夸地说，至今为止我所制作的武器，可从来没有出过任何问题！,I can boast to say that there have never been any problems with the weapons I have made so far!
是的，一名工匠往往要拥有打造成百上千件装备的经验后，才能成为一代名师。,"Yes, a craftsman often needs to have the experience of building hundreds of equipment before he can become a master of a generation."
我就知道你从来都不会让我失望，没有比世界末日更容易创造一个新秩序的机会了。,I know you never let me down. There is no better opportunity to create a new order in doomsday.
啊啦……你瞒不住我，你早就有将各大神系神明收入麾下的野心了，对吧？,"Well, You can't shield it from me. You already have ambitions to command all the gods, right?"
真的么？你不是在安慰我吧？不过就算你只是安慰我，我也挺高兴的就是了……,"Really? Are you comforting me? But even if you just simply comfort me, I'm pretty happy..."
啊啦，统治世界之后，就算我是恶魔，不也可以名正言顺地和你每天呆在一块了么？,"Ah, after rule the world, even if I am a devil, I can stay with you justifiably every day, can't I?"
是么，小可爱？那么为什么现在和你在这里亲密交谈的是我，而不是别的女孩子呢？,"Really, my little one? So why is it me that is talking to you intimately here, not other girls?"
啊啦……真是个诚实的家伙呢，今晚有兴趣来我的房间，陪我度过漫漫长夜么？,"Ah...what an honest guy, are you interested in coming to my room tonight and spending a long night with me?"
是啊，我很有兴趣和她们好好亲热亲热，比如她们中那个叫米迦勒的家伙……,"Yes, I'm very interested in making friends with them, such as the guy named Michael..."
真让我惊讶！我可从没想过你真的能接受这么极端但明智的建议呢！,It surprised me! I never thought you could really accept such extreme but wise advice!
嗯……你的身材也很适合跳舞呢！有兴趣让我教教你吗？,Hmm...your figure is also suitable for dancing! Are you interested in learning from me?
哼哼……舞蹈可不仅是表演，如果搭配上武器的运用，可是非常致命的进攻手段！,"Hum...Dance is not only performance. If it is combined with the use of weapons, it can become a very deadly offensive method!"
你运气不错呢！这枚特殊的硬币送给你作为纪念吧！别小瞧它，带着可会有好运喔！,"You are lucky! Give this special coin to you as a souvenir! Don't despise it, you will have good luck with it!"
太遗憾了是正面，看来作为胜利女神，哪怕是猜硬币，我也从来不会输给任何人呢！,"Unfortunately, it came down heads. It seems that as the goddess of victory, even if tossing a coin, I will never lose!"
我会以此为荣的，我很期待能够在未来的战斗中，继续尽力地支持同伴们。,I will be proud of this. I look forward to supporting my companions as best as I can in future battles.
我……我其实很早就有这样的想法了……只是……只是不好意思和大家说……,I... I actually had this idea a long time ago... I just...just too shy to tell others...
我并不反对你这样说，但如果没有律法，世间的万事万物都将失去原则和公平。,"I do not oppose you saying this, but if there is no law, everything in the world will lose principle and fairness."
我很欣慰您作为众神的指挥官，能够明白律法对于军团的重要性。,"I am very pleased that you, as the commander of the gods, are aware of the importance of the law to the army."
审判永远跟随着为恶者的命运，他们永远无法逃脱复仇女神的脚步。,The trial always follows the fate of the evil ones. They can never escape from the goddess of vengeance.
人类是我见过的最狂妄的种族，但或许正是这样，才让人类拥有了改变命运的机会。,"Humans are the most unbridled and conceited race I have ever seen, but perhaps it is this that allows humans to change their fate."
自古正义难成，但我绝不会因此而退缩，罪恶不尽，复仇不止。,"Justice has been difficult to reach since ancient times, but I will never flinch from it. As far as the crime is endless, the revenge is endless."
我并不希望你背负和我的命运，复仇和正义都太沉重了，我更愿意看到你的微笑。,"I don't want you to bear the destiny with me, because revenge and justice are too heavy. I would rather see your smile."
我倒想去掉这能力，因为相对于提升战斗力，我更在意不能与中意的人四目相对……,"I want to get rid of this ability, because instead of improving combat power, I care more about not being able to face the person I like..."
看来你已经有喜欢的女孩子了啊，如果拥有这样的力量，就不能好好欣赏她了。,"It seems that you already have a girl you like. If you have such skill, you can't look at her well."
嗯……这样啊……那么下一个问题是，你会介意人类与蛇发女妖之间的恋情么……,"Hmm...well...then the next question is, do you mind the love between humans and the Gorgon..."
啊……但这样好像反而让我对这种禁断之恋更憧憬了呢……,Ah... but this seems to make me even more yearning for this forbidden love...
是么？！那么我想知道，这个时代年轻的人类女孩子喜欢穿什么样的时装？,"Are they? ! Then I want to know, what kind of fashion do young human girls like to wear at this time?"
啊……你这么说我还挺不好意思的！看来内在和性格才是最大的魅力吗……,Ah... I'm embarrassed to hear that! It seems that inner and personality is the greatest charm...
今晚有兴趣陪我聊聊么？或许克里特岛的葡萄酒可以让我们享受一个美妙的夜晚。,Are you interested in chatting with me tonight? Perhaps the wines from Crete can make us enjoy a wonderful evening.
人类于黑暗中诞生，却向往光明，这实在是一件有趣的事情……,"Human beings were born in the dark, but yearn for the light. This is really an interesting thing..."
是啊，或许命运也希望我不要过多干涉这个世界的纷争……,"Yes, maybe destiny also hopes that I will not interfere too much in the disputes in this world..."
啊啦……至今还没有人类对我说过这句话，但若你愿意，我很期待和你共度的时光。,"Ahh.. no human beings have said this to me yet, but if you want, I am looking forward to spending time with you."
就是说嘛！虽然我的战斗力并非最强，但战争最重要的可是侦察和通信呐！,"Yes, you are right! Although my combat power is not the strongest, the most important thing in war is reconnaissance and communication!"
不会发生这种事的！如果不信的话我可以抱着你一块飞，让你亲眼见识一下！,"It will never happen! If you don't believe me, I can fly with you and let you see it with your own eyes!"
下次我来画一张你的写生！这样我们的战斗力就可以增加一倍啦！,"Next time I will draw a sketch of you! In this way, our combat power can be doubled!"
有兴趣学吗？！我也可以教你哟！不过我得先确认你的绘画技巧不会太糟……,Are you interested in learning? I can teach you! But I have to make sure that your drawing skills are not too bad...
等这场灾难结束后，我很乐意在余下的时光中和你研究琵琶与乐理。,"After this disaster is over, I will be happy to study the Chinese lute and music theory with you for the rest of the time."
乐器的演奏需要宁静的心与优雅的氛围，如果你想听的话，晚上来我的房间好了……,"The performance of musical instruments requires a tranquil heart and an elegant atmosphere. If you want to listen, come to my room at night..."
如果是由你来统领众神，平息战争的话，这一天或许能尽早到来……,"If it is you to lead the gods and quell the war, this day might come as soon as possible..."
你说得对，消沉只会埋没希望和决心，与其叹息，不如向这末日的命运抗争。,"You are right. Depression will only bury hope and determination. Instead of sighing, it is better to fight this doomsday destiny."
啊……作为地狱的头号偶像和路西法的首席先锋，莉莉丝最近的业绩又不够啦！,"Well... As hell's number one idol and Lucifer's leading pioneer, Lilith's recent performance is not enough!"
别多疑啦！如果你愿意签的话，莉莉丝很乐意给你开一场单独的演出喔！,"Stop being suspicious! If you are willing to sign, Lilith is happy to give you a solo show!"
大自然的力量总是值得信任和依靠的，在战场上她可比我更能打呢！,The power of nature is always worthy of trust and reliance. She can fight better than me on the battlefield!
啊啦……在战场上，不少敌人在被她拍晕前也是这么说的呢！,"Well, on the battlefield, many enemies said the same before being stunned by her!"
哼哼……看看这逐渐觉醒的力量，我迟早会成为同伴们认可的领袖！,Hum...Look at this awakening power. Sooner or later I will become the leader recognized by my companions!
怎么感觉你对我没什么信心，要我给你一拳证明一下吗？！,Why I feel that you have no confidence in me. Do you want me to give you a punch to prove it? !
看来神与人确实没什么差别，英雄也会为贯彻正确的理念而战斗的。,It seems that there is no difference between gods and humans. Heroes will also fight to implement the correct ideas.
我也这么想，有时间天天打架，不如坐下来喝杯红茶，玩一局扑克。,"I think so too. Instead of wasting time fighting every day, I'd rather sit down and have a cup of black tea and play poker games."
你在说什么呢！等……等等！你在看哪里？！我要生气了！！,"What are you talking about! Wait, where are you looking at? ! I'm going to be angry! !"
我也这么觉得！巫女服可是正义与高雅的象征呐！,I think so too! The witch costume is a symbol of justice and elegance!
哼！等解决眼下魔物的麻烦后，我很期待和你在球场上过几招！,"Humph! After solving the monster's troubles at the moment, I am looking forward to competing with you on the court!"
至少击打方面你肯定没我强，教室碎掉的窗户可都是我本垒打的杰作呐！,At least you are definitely not as strong as me in hitting. The broken windows in the classroom are all my masterpieces of home runs!
你……你为什么盯着我的胸部看？！这可没影响我拉弓！,You... why are you staring at my breasts? ! That does not affect my bow!
哼！我眼神可一点也不差，至少十米内用小刀丢中苹果不成问题！,Humph! My eyes are not bad at all. It is not a problem to throw an apple with a knife within ten meters!
嗯！青春可是得在赛场和沙滩上挥霍才有价值呢！,Haha! Youth are valuable on the field and on the beach!
你这话真是直接……嘛，虽然我对自己的身材很有自信就是了……,"What you said is really direct... Well, though I am confident about my figure..."
没必要怀疑，每个从世上离去的人，总会以另一种方式再次相遇的。,There is no need to doubt that everyone who has left the world will always meet again in another way.
呵呵……等你离开这个世界的时候，或许你会理解吧……,"Haha...When you leave this world, maybe you will understand..."
这也是我曾经的选择，但在见证无数离别后，我剩下的却只有孤独……,"This was also my choice, but after witnessing countless farewells, all I have left is loneliness..."
有趣的回答呢，作为人类，如烟花一般的生命，短暂而灿烂。,"That is quite an interesting answer. As human beings, life is like fireworks-short but brilliant."
哟，感觉你我有那么点相似呢，难道你在我命运中也有一丝羁绊？,"Oh, it feels like you and I are so similar. Maybe you also have a little string in my fate?"
哼……观赏人类在不可改变的命运前无奈挣扎，倒也是种乐趣呢……,Huh... It's fun to watch human beings struggle helplessly in front of an unchangeable destiny...
嘻嘻……和我这个掌管厄运的少女呆在一块，至少能保护你不倒霉吧。,"Heehee... Staying with me, a girl in charge of bad luck, can at least protect you from bad luck."
嘻嘻……如果你吃完香蕉不乱丢香蕉皮的话，应该能躲掉一劫……,"Heehee...If you don't throw away the banana skin after eating the banana, you should be able to dodge a bullet..."
让我来看看你喜欢的人是谁……什……什么呀！你真是个大胆的人呢！,Let me see who you like...Wow! You are such a bold person!
啊，命运告诉我，你会喜欢上长着猫耳，爱睡懒觉的可爱女孩子呢……,"Ah, destiny tells me that you will like a cute girl with cat ears and she likes sleeping late..."
我可没这么软弱！但……但你想安慰我的话，就破例让你抱一下好了！,"I am not so feeble! But... But if you want to comfort me, I'll make a change to let you hug me!"
哟……难得你能说出这么有艺术感的话呢，真是让我惊讶……,"Wow... it's rare that you can say such artistic words, it surprised me..."
我知道一个晒太阳的好地方！不过我得先问问，你……有恐高症吗？,"I know a good place to bask in the sun! But I have to ask first, are you... scared of heights?"
多晒几次就习惯啦！不想拥有一身小麦色的健康肌肤吗？,Get used to it a few more times! Don't you want to have healthy tan skin?
啊啦，别这么害羞嘛……欣赏埃及女孩子的美妙身姿可是一种享受呢！,"Come on, don't be so shy... Appreciating the beautiful figure of Egyptian girls is a kind of enjoyment!"
真的？！努特自己也这么认为！作为回报给你一个kiss吧！Chu！,"Really? ! Nuit thinks so too! In return, give you a kiss! Chu!"
我的“沙漠”今晚也渴求一场温柔的雨滋润呢……所以……今晚你有空吗？,My desert also longs for a gentle rain tonight...so...are you free tonight?
打伞可太没情调了！你不觉得雨中浑身湿透的女孩子是一种美吗？,Umbrellas are too boring! Don't you think that a girl soaked in the rain is a kind of beauty?
千金易得，知己难求，或许我的艺术就是为你而存在的也说不定……,It's easy to get thousands of money but hard to find a truly friend. Maybe my art exists for you...
若你愿一直陪伴我的话，你迟早会懂的……,"If you are willing to stay with me forever, you will understand sooner or later..."
或许是吧，阴阳万变，没有战争的残酷，何来和平的美好呢……,"Perhaps it is, the good and bad are ever-changing. Without the cruelty of war, how can the peace come..."
等这场灾难结束后，我会和你一起去世界各地，好好修复这件艺术品。,"After this disaster is over, I will go around the world with you to restore this artwork."
有时我感叹天地的无情，但这也是大自然的规则，难以违抗……,"Sometimes I sigh for the mercilessness of heaven and earth, but this is also the rule of nature and it is hard to break..."
虽然我并不想这么说，但没有力量的善良，或许只是软弱而已。,"Although I don't want to say that, kindness without power may just be weakness."
看来我们确实心有灵犀，我一直希望自己能够如大地般温柔。,It seems that we are heart to heart. I always hope that I can be as gentle as the earth.
看来你能看到我内心中对艺术的那份热忱，很少有人会这样理解我。,It seems that you can see the enthusiasm for art in my heart. Few people understand me like this.
是吗？那作为整个大和神系最强射手的我，就更有和你一较高下的价值了！,"Are you? As the best archery of the Yamato god pedigree, it becomes more worthy to compete with you!"
掌握技巧之后还是很简单的，如果你有兴趣的话，我可以亲自教你哦！,"After mastering the skills, it is very simple. If you are interested, I can teach you personally!"
那玩意叫“电视”么？到底是什么魔法可以做到把人关进盒子里的……,Is that thing called TV? What kind of magic can lock people in boxes...
我以为是魔物，就一箭把它射爆了……你为什么看着我笑！我是不是做了什么蠢事？,"I thought it was a monster, so I shot it with one arrow... Why did you look at me and laugh! Did I do something stupid?"
那真是太让人期待了！晚上见！对了，要我帮你准备浴衣吗？！,"That's really exciting! See you tonight! By the way, do you want me to prepare a yukata for you? !"
哼哼……是要去和别的女孩子约会么？你的脸很红呢……,Humph... Are you going to date other girls? Your face is very red...
原来这东西叫照相机啊……在绘画和记录方面，这东西可比魔法好用多啦！,"Ah! So this thing is called a camera... In terms of painting and recording, this thing is much useful than the magic!"
你怎么忽然对着我……这太突然了！等……等等！我需要换一件漂亮些的和服！,Why are you suddenly facing me... It's too sudden! Wait wait wait! I need to change into a more beautiful kimono!
真的吗？但可惜的是你并非凡人或是普通的神明，即使是我也预测不出你的将来。,"Really? But it's a pity that you are not an ordinary mortal or an ordinary god, even I can't predict your future."
其实不管是凡人还是神明，知道自己的命运未必是一件好事。,"In fact, whether you are a mortal or a god, knowing your own destiny is not necessarily a good thing."
你指的是北欧的诺伦三姐妹吗？有可能，我感到身体里有她们的灵魂碎片存在……,"Are you referring to the three sisters of Nornir in Norse? Possibly, I feel that there are fragments of their souls in my body..."
希腊的摩伊拉三姐妹？或许吧……我感到有时在梦境里她们会出现……,The three sisters of Moirai in Greece? Maybe...I feel that sometimes they appear in dreams...
这场灾难结束之后，我很希望能有机会，和你一起享受茶和点心的午后……,"After this disaster is over, I really hope to have the opportunity to enjoy the afternoon tea and snacks with you..."
看来相比于安宁的和平时期，你或许更适合这个战争四起的冒险年代……,It seems that you might be more suitable for this adventurous age when there are wars than a peaceful period...
从古至今，凡人大多只会向我寻求帮助，我也从未想过会有需要凡人帮助的一天……,"From ancient times to the present, most mortals would only ask me for help, and I never thought that there would be a day when I need help from a mortal..."
啊啦……是吗？那么你的命运就是负责和我一起找回我失去的神力。,Ah...Really? Then your fate is responsible for retrieving my lost divine power with me.
真的？我倒觉得这些所谓的称呼和身份，除了引发神系战争外，没起到什么作用……,Really? I feel that these so-called titles and identities have no effect other than triggering a war between the gods...
就是，有讨论这些的时间不如做一些有意义的事，例如……和中意之人来一场约会？,"Yes. It is better to do something meaningful when you have time to discuss these things, such as... have a date with someone you like?"
因为最终这些世俗的东西都将迎来死亡，黄泉之国是唯一永恒的归宿。,"Because eventually these worldly things will usher in death, and the netherworld is the only eternal destination."
喔？那么如果有一天，我希望你为了我放弃凡尘的一切，你会作何选择呢？,"Oh? So if one day, I hope you give up everything that is mundane for me, what choice would you make?"
你或许没说错，我很中意强者，尤其是比我更强、让我能有安全感的家伙……,"Maybe you are right. I like the strong, especially those who are stronger than me and make me feel safe..."
爱是大多数人随口说说的浪漫谎言罢了，但你却让我感受到了一种不曾有过的温暖。,"Love is a romantic lie that most people talk casually, but you make me feel a warmth that I have never had before."
喔哟……需要考虑这么久吗？还是说……我在你的眼中还不够有魅力？,Hey...does it take so long to think about it? Or... I am not attractive enough in your eyes?
哎呀呀呀……你是在说我吗？虽然我喜欢直白的人，但太直白就不够浪漫了呢！,"Oh dear... are you talking about me? Although I like straightforward people, being too straightforward is not romantic enough!"
是吗？让我来猜猜看吧，嗯……你得了一种名为“爱情”的病，已经无药可救啦！,"Really? Let me guess, um... you have a virus called love, and there is no cure for it!"
那……那个……难不成你在想喜欢的女孩子？,Emmm...is...is it a girl you like?
我原以为你对狗狗更感兴趣呢！我也很喜欢猫，只是拿它们多变的性格有些没辙……,"I thought you were more interested in dogs! I also like cats very much, but I am weak to their changeable personality..."
是吗？！我尤其喜欢柴犬呢！温驯、聪明、活泼，和它在一起你心情总会变得很棒！,"Really? ! I especially like Shiba Inu! They are gentle, smart, and lively, you will always be in a great mood with them!"
哼哼！我想也是！丘比特在对待人和人的缘分上太随性啦！恋情可不能开玩笑！,Aha! I think so too! Cupid is too casual in her treatment of people and their fate! Love can't be a joke!
哎呀呀呀……没想到你挺温柔的嘛，即使你认为丘比特更优秀，我也不会生气的喔！,"Awwwwww... I didn't expect that you are so gentle. Even if you think Cupid is better, I won't be angry!"
并不，我见过很多在战场上的对决，也见过这些对决过后诞生的恋情……,"No,I don't hate. I have seen a lot of duels on the battlefield, and have also seen romances born after these duels..."
哼哼，我看见你与女孩子们羁绊的丝线……复杂得都快成一张网了……哎呀呀呀……,"Hmph, I see the thread that binds you to the girls... It's so complicated that it's almost forming a net..oh my gosh..."
这可是趟不短的旅程，不过我很乐意有你的陪伴。,"This is a long journey, but I would love to have your company."
你说得没错，对于大地而言，无论多重的伤，都会随着时间的流转慢慢愈合。,"You are right. As far as the earth is concerned, no matter how many injuries it is, it will slowly heal over time."
是啊，和自己中意的人一块享受午后的阳光，还有比这更让人更期待的吗？,"Yes, enjoying the afternoon sun with someone you like, is there anything more to look forward to than this?"
啊啦……你的意思难道是……希望我在晒太阳时穿得更“凉爽”些？,Mmmm...do you mean you want me to dress more cooler when basking?
哼哼，等这次战争结束后，我们一起去开一家猫主题咖啡厅怎么样？,"Hum, how about opening a cat concept cafe together after this war is over?"
是啊，在埃及的一些传说中，猫是神明的使者，不少还能变成可爱的女孩子呢！,"Yes, in some Egyptian legends, cats are messengers of gods, and some can also become cute girls!"
啊！你什么时候在那儿的！我……我只是在练习演话剧要背的台词而已！,Oops! When did you come! I...I was just practicing the lines in a drama!
啊啦……这台词真是太帅啦！很适合在击败魔物首领之后作为胜利者大声喊出来呢！,Ah...This line is so goooood! It is very suitable to shout out loudly as the winner after defeating the monster boss!
哼哼，努特在埃及众神中无论是神能还是魅力确实都很优秀，但我还是略胜一筹呢！,"Humph, Nuit is indeed very good in terms of power and charm among the Egyptian gods, but I am still a notch above her!"
啊啦……难得看到你这么犹豫呢！要不要今天晚上来我房间，让我告诉你正确答案？,Well... It's rare to see you hesitate! How about coming to my room tonight and let me tell you the correct answer?
作为埃及的主神不应在同伴面前表现出任何软弱，我也只能和你感叹命运的残酷了。,"As the main god of Egypt, I should not show any weakness in front of my companions. I can only sigh the cruelty of fate with you."
嗯……偶尔在日落时分和你静静地拥抱一会，也是一种难得的安慰……,"Hhm...hugging you quietly at sunset sometimes, is also a luxury comfort..."
是吗？的确，这种风格相对于其他服装，更容易展现出女孩子的肌肤和身材呢……,"Really? Indeed, compared to other clothing, this style is easier to show the girl's skin and figure..."
啊啦……我可猜不出来，不过每次从你身边经过时，你火热的眼神可不会说谎喔……,"Well...I can't guess it, but every time you pass by, your fiery eyes won't lie..."
其实……我还挺认同你当我的指挥官，至少你是一个足够强的统帅！,"Actually... I quite agree with you as my commander, at least you are a strong enough commander!"
其他人这么回答的话，我肯定会把他揍飞，但至少你用行动证明了你对正义的坚持。,"If others answer this way, I will definitely beat him up, but at least you have proved your insistence on justice with your actions."
这正是作为众神统帅所需要的优秀素质！作为你的同伴，我以你为荣。,"This is the excellent quality needed as a commander of the gods! As your companion, I am proud of you."
没有必要质疑自己，即使你真的坠入深渊，我也始终与你同在。,"There is no need to doubt yourself, even if you really fall into the abyss, I will always be with you."
并非如此，没有力量的正义是无法对抗黑暗的，宽容也不意味着没有原则的纵容。,"Well, it isn't. Justice without power cannot fight against darkness, and tolerance does not mean indulging without principles."
作为一个凡人，你能意识到这个道理我还是挺意外的，你的智慧值得欣赏。,"As a mortal, I am quite surprised that you can realize this truth, and your wisdom is worthy of appreciation."
我在战场上曾和路西法有过接触，她的行为虽然没有正义可言，但意外地挺讲原则。,"I had met with Lucifer on the battlefield once. Although her behavior was not justified, she was unexpectedly principled."
你说得没错，至少米迦勒、拉斐尔和加百列不会那么轻易地同意这件事。,"You are right, at least Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel will not agree to this easily."
呵呵……至少我们在一起的这段时间，比我过去独自一人时有趣得多。,Haha... At least the time we were together was much more interesting than when I was alone.
那当然，我可不希望在战场上看见你像个菜鸟一样，被敌人打飞几十米……,"Of course, I don't want to see you on the battlefield like a rookie, being beaten by the enemy then fly away tens of meters..."
掌管生与死的巫女除了引导生灵之外，也需要照亮亡者们的道路喔。,"As a witch who is in charge of life and death, I not only guide the living creatures, but also need to illuminate the path for the dead."
这盏灯笼照亮的是冥界之路，我们能避掉很多魔物，少惹很多麻烦可都是拜它所赐。,"This lantern illuminates the road to the underworld. Thanks to it, we can avoid a lot of monsters and troubles."
喔？不管是否能做到，至少你现在的气势还挺足，我打赌你至少能坚持……一个月？,"Oh? Regardless of whether you can do or not, at least your current momentum is quite strong, I bet you can at least hold on for... a month?"
犹豫就会败北，这话出自一名传说中的日本剑客，嘛……我猜你说不定也听过……,"If you hesitate, you will lose. This is from a legendary Japanese swordsman. Well... I guess you might have heard it..."
啊啦……真是让我有一点点小失落呢，我原以为你会给我个更大胆些的答案……,Ah...It really made me feel a little bit disappointed. I thought you would give me a bolder answer...
啊啦……如果直接告诉你就太没情调和气氛了，今晚来我的房间再告诉你怎么样？,Ahhhhh...it would be too unromantic to tell you directly. How about coming to my room tonight?
时间是治愈大地最好的良药，我只希望这场战争能够尽快结束。,Time is the best medicine to cure the earth. I only hope that this war can end as soon as possible.
其实无所谓，大地总会将从我这里取走的东西，馈赠给更适合的人。,"In fact, it doesn't matter. The earth will always give something that it takes from me to a more suitable person."
她的性格大多数时候过于随性，在埃及她惹的麻烦比她解决的还多……,"Her character is too casual most of the time, and she caused more troubles in Egypt than she solved..."
她实力确实不错，但作为统帅，你很快就会认识到，她不大理解什么叫做命令……,"She is indeed good at strength, but as the commander, you will soon realize that she doesn't quite understand what a command is..."
你还是太年轻了，当成为众神都认同的主宰者时，你才真正算理解孤独的意义。,You are still too young. Only when you become the ruler recognized by the gods can you truly understand the meaning of loneliness.
有趣，我见过无数的王者，还从没有人这样说过，你确实是一名独特的统帅。,"Interesting. I have seen countless kings, and no one has ever said that. You are indeed a unique commander."
它是这个北欧的支柱，作为曾经的王者，我很怀念站在树顶俯视一切的感觉……,"It is the pillar of this Nordic country. As a former king, I miss the feeling of standing on the top of a tree and looking down on everything..."
很少有人类会给我这么坚定的回答，或许你真的能成为众神的领袖。,"Few humans will give me such a firm answer, maybe you can really become the leader of the gods."
哼……其他人说出这样的话，我只会认为他是个愚者，但我认同你的能力和智慧。,"Hmph...If other people say this, I will only think that he is a fool, but I agree with your ability and wisdom."
这是一场要拼上性命的赌局，但我相信有你在的话，没有什么敌人能让我们畏惧。,"This is a bet that risking life, but I believe that with you, there is no enemy that can make us fear."
我曾为了获得智慧而甘愿付出一只眼睛的代价，但我明白智者将永远立于不败之地。,"I was willing to pay the price of one eye in order to gain wisdom, but I understand that the wise man will always be invincible."
我曾经是众神的统治者，但你才是众神的将来，我希望你能替我执掌这份荣耀。,"I used to be the ruler of the gods, but you are the future of the gods. I hope you can hold this glory for me."
看来时代变了，如今我作为众神的同伴，确实比作为众神的统帅更容易亲近他人。,"It seems that the times have changed. Now, as a companion of the gods, it is indeed easier for me to get close to others than as the commander of the gods."
真的？看来有人值得让我花上一晚的时间，和一瓶上等的蜂蜜酒好好招待了。,Really? It seems that someone deserves to spend a night on me and entertain him with a good bottle of mead.
这可真让人苦恼呢！我的理想可是当一名偶像啊！,This is really distressing! My ideal is to be an idol!
真的吗？！为了防止意外，要不要我先找根绳子把你困在桅杆上？,"Oh, really? ! To prevent accidents, should I find a rope to trap you on the mast?"
是啊，末日还没结束，我可不想去看喷发的火山和满是尘埃的废墟。,"Yes, doomsday is not over yet, I don't want to see erupting volcanoes and dusty ruins."
我当然能够上岸，前提是你抱得动我的话，嘻嘻……,"Of course I can go ashore, the premise is that you can hold me, haha..."
原来真的是这样啊！这实在是令人兴奋……啊不不不！令人遗憾的事情呢……,So that's true! This is so exciting...ah no no no.. so regrettable...
噗哧！怎么会呢？我只是想看看，曾经威严无比的海皇大人如今的尊容而已……,Haha! How could I? I just want to see the face of the god of the sea who is majestic in the past...
万事万物都遵循自然的规则，命运没有必要回避，磨难会让大地变得更坚实。,Everything follows the rules of nature. There is no need to avoid fate. The tribulation will make the earth more solid.
并不会，万物生生不息、循环往复，即便一时沉寂，也终会在大地的怀抱中重生。,"No, I won't. Everything is endless and cyclical. Even if it is silent for a while, it will eventually be reborn on the earth."
所以不管遇到任何麻烦，请一定要告诉我，至少我应当和你共同面对。,"So no matter what trouble you encounter, please tell me. At least I should face it with you."
嗯……看来在你的眼里，我比想象中要年轻很多呢……,"Hmm... It seems that in your eyes, I am much younger than I thought..."
你有着和我一样坚强的意志和灵魂，希望众神能在你的统率下度过这场浩劫……,You have the same strong will and soul like mine. I hope that the gods can survive this calamity under your command...
的确，即使一个人拥有再强的力量，也未必有众多可以信赖的同伴可靠。,"Indeed. No matter how strong a person is, he may not have enough reliable companions."
即使是最朴素的花朵也能用它独特的芬芳，驱散战争的阴云。,Even the simplest flower can use its unique fragrance to dispel the dark clouds of war.
树木是万象复苏的征兆，即使没有花草的艳丽，但却能缓慢治愈大地的伤痕。,"Trees are a sign of recovery. Even they are not beautiful as flowers, they can slowly heal the scars of the earth."
当然，如果让我恢复到神力的鼎盛时期，终结这场世界末日……恐怕只需要几天。,"Of course, if I were to return to the heyday of divine power, then end this doomsday... I am afraid it will only take a few days."
安心吧，我并不会因此而消沉，在见证你的成长后，我已经看见了新的希望。,"Don't worry, I will not be depressed because of this. After witnessing your growth, I have fresh hope."
啊啦……真的吗？！我明天就把你丢进迷宫中心，看看是不是这样。,Ah...really? ! I will throw you into the center of the labyrinth tomorrow to see if this is true.
其实，如果你有兽人强大的力量，见墙就拆，迟早你能出去。,"In fact, if you have the power as orc, you can destroy walls when you face them, and sooner or later you can get out."
去寻找值得为之牺牲的理念吧，无论你迷惘或恐惧，我始终会守护你。,"Find an idea worthy of sacrifice. Whether you are confused or fearful, I will always guard you."
呵呵……永远沉浸在梦中，梦就是真实，还有比这更美妙的事吗……,"Haha...Always immersed in dreams, dreams are reality, is there anything more wonderful than this..."
哼，真是个没情调的家伙，至少我也算是个有梦想的人啊。,"Hmph, what an unromantic guy, at least I have dreams."
对我来说这真是不容易的事情呢……不过有你在，或许我也能有所改变。,"For me, this is really not easy...but with you, maybe I can change myself."
看来为了达成这个心愿，只好让全世界的人永远都醒不过来了。,"Then in order to make this dream come true, it seems that people all over the world will never be able to wake up."
嗯？是么？但只有强者能够掌控自己和世界的命运，这难道不对吗？,"Ok, is it? But only the strong can control the destiny of himself and the world, is that right?"
世间本无善恶之分，善良或许也只是强者所定义的呢……,There is no difference between good and evil in the world. Maybe kindness is only defined by the strong...
说的也是，靠这种能力得到的感情，又有什么意义呢？,You're right. What's the point if gained love by this kind of ability?
是个诚实而可爱的家伙呢！那么老实告诉我……你现在在想什么？,"Oh, what an honest and cute guy! Then tell me honestly...what are you thinking about now?"
哼哼！可别以为我还会像上次那样输给你！接招吧！,Haha! Don't think I will lose to you like last time! Take it!
喂！你这个借口已经用了三次了！啊……算了，我还是去打木桩吧……,"Hey! You have used this excuse three times! Ah...Forget it, I'll practice on the timber pile..."
的确如此，智慧始于火种，文明也是靠这小小的火苗而兴盛的。,"Exactly. Wisdom begins with fire, and civilization also thrives on this little fire."
或许吧，火焰带来了智慧，却也点燃了王国的争端和掠夺的欲望……,"Perhaps. The flame brings wisdom, but it also ignites disputes in the kingdom and the desire to plunder..."
就是嘛！解决麻烦的家伙只需要一拳，如果不够……呃……那就两拳！,"Exactly! The troublesome people only need one punch, if it is not enough...uh... then two punches!"
我天生就不是个擅长讲道理的人，不过你每次总有办法让我冷静下来。,"I am not born to be good at reasoning, but you always have a way to calm me down every time."
没什么比上战场前，来一大碗满是辣椒和烤肉的炒饭更给力的了！,There is nothing better than a big bowl of rice full of chili and roast meat before going to the battlefield!
嗯哼……然而喜欢火辣的女孩子总是受欢迎喔！不管是性格，还是身材……,Hmm... But girls who like hot are always popular! Whether it's character or figure...
你很有眼光呢！要不要来我的房间……让我教教你怎样穿……？,You have really good taste! Do you want to come to my room and...let me teach you how to dress...?
缠的时候是挺麻烦的，不过脱下来却很方便呢！想试试看吗？,"It's troublesome to wrap it around, but it's very convenient to take it off! Do you want to try it?"
青春是无价的财富呢，无论外貌、活力还是激情，都伴随着青春才有意义！,"Youth is an invaluable wealth. No matter appearance, vitality or passion, it is meaningful with youth!"
不会吧？！我还从来没有见过一个凡人不渴求青春永驻的呢！,No way? ! I have never seen a mortal who does not long for eternal youth!
哈哈，我听说女神雅典娜、赫拉和阿芙罗狄忒她们为此打得不可开交呢！,"Haha, I heard that the goddesses Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite are fighting hard for this!"
你觉得不会？！来打个赌吧？我想到一个好玩的恶作剧，嘻嘻……,"You think it won't? ! Let's make a bet. I think of a funny prank, hee hee..."
你……没骗我吧？如果骗我的话，我一辈子都不会放过你的！,"You didn't lie to me, did you? If you lie to me, I will never forgive you!"
说得也是呢 ……凡人们的爱情，很多时候都会随着青春的逝去而消散吧。,That's right... Most often mortals' love will disappear with the passing of youth.
音乐是一首歌曲的灵魂呐，有兴趣静静听我演唱一段吗？,Music is the soul of a song. Are you interested in listening to me sing a song?
诗词总是能很好地传达人们的情感，要看看我新写的作品吗？,Poetry can always express people's emotions well. Would you like to see my new poetry?
如果你愿意和咱换的话，咱就送你一件意想不到的礼物喵！,"If you are willing to exchange with me, I will give you an extraordinary gift!"
哎呀呀呀，你可真是个不会说谎的人呢！不给我的话我就要挠你啦！,"Awww, you are such a liar! If you don't give it to me, I will scratch you!"
呀！！你在说我很可爱喵？是吧？！一定是这样的吧！！,"Oh! ! Did you say I'm so cute, right? ! It must be so! !"
哼哼哼……我今天晚上就会偷偷潜进你的卧室把你吃掉，小心喵……,"Hum, I will sneak into your bedroom tonight and eat you, be careful miaow..."
真的？！咱下次请你去参加动物妖怪朋友们的聚会怎么样？！,Really? ! How about next time I invite you to a party with animal monster friends? !
喵……是那种让人脸红心跳的羞羞的关系吗……你可真是直接喵……,Miaow...Is it the kind of shy relationship that makes people blush...You are really direct meow...
哎呀呀，如果你肯用小鱼干来交换的话，那就让你摸一下喵！,"Well, if you are willing to give me fish, then I'll allow you to touch meow!"
没想到竟然有人能忍住咱的毛茸茸诱惑攻击！你真的是人类喵？！,I never thought who could hold back our furry temptation strikes! Are you really a human meow? !
真的吗？虽然咱在变成妖怪前，确实也见过不少好人喵……,Really? Although I did see a lot of good people before I became a monster...
唉……有小鱼干却不懂得分享给朋友，是多么遗憾的事情喵……,Alas...it's a shame to have fish but don't know how to share it with friends miaow...
是吗？！哼哼！我一定会成为你最可靠的战友喵！！,Is it? ! Humph! I will definitely become your most reliable comrade miaow! !
我感觉自己很强大了喵！那么大的石头只要一喵爪就能击碎了呢！,I think I'm strong miaow. Such a big stone can be crushed with just one paw!
我一定要和你一起结束这场浩劫，取回原本属于我自己的神权！,I must end this catastrophe with you and regain the divine power that originally belonged to me!
我也应该感谢这命运吧，如果不是这样，我也不会与你相遇了……,"I should also be grateful for this destiny. If it weren't like this, I wouldn't meet you..."
是吗？我还从来没见过能赢我的人类，有机会一定要和你较量较量！,"Really? I have never seen a human being able to beat me, and I must compete with you if I have a chance!"
要我来教你冲浪吗？我会好好抱紧你的，至少你不用担心一沉到底……,"Do you want me to teach you surfing? I will hold you tight, at least you don't have to worry about sinking to the bottom..."
在奥林匹斯众神的那个年代，战争就没有尽头，但我早已厌倦……,"In the days of Olympus, the wars are endless. I was already tired of wars..."
如果真的有战争结束的一天，我就带你一块回海底宫殿生活怎么样？,"If there is a day when the war is over, how about taking you to the underwater palace and living with me?"
荷花生于污泥却一尘不染，如同这个灾难不断的世界中诞生的正义一样。,"You have good taste. The lotus flower is born in the mud but emerges spotless, just as rightful justice is born from a world of constant strife."
平凡其实是一种伟大，我们原本都是凡人，却因自己的信念而胜过神明。,"In my perspective, blood is the inheritance of the family. Even if the bonds are fragile, it is an unbreakable reality bestowed by the gods."
没错，血缘是家族的传承，即使再脆弱，这也是一种不可斩断的羁绊与命运。,"In my percepective, blood is the inheritance of the family. Even if the bonds are fragile, it is an unbreakable reality bestowed by the gods."
或许你是正确的吧，至少我们之间的羁绊证明了这一点。,"Maybe you are right, for the bond we share proves that other types of relationshps may be even stronger."
我明白，从一开始，你和我的命运就始终连在一起，只要你在我就无所畏惧。,"Well, you are right. Grief should be used as a driving force to prevent disaster."
巴里在这个世界神力比我弱很多，但她依旧不放弃与末日抗争，我岂能在此退却？,"Princess Bari may be much weaker than me, but she never stops fighting. And neither shall I."
嗯，你说得没错，悲伤应当化为阻止灾难的力量，而非恐惧末日的枷锁。,"Well, you are right. Grief should be turned into a drive to prevent disaster."
末日的结束或许还要很久吧，希望我们能够挽回更多的生命。,"I don't know when the war will end. In the meantime, I hope we can save more lives."
只是同伴么？我……我觉得你对我的感情似乎没有这么单纯呢……,A companion? I... I thought we are much more than that.
那个……家人也有很多种，例如长辈、恋人等等……我们应该算是哪类呢？,"Well... there are many kinds of family members, such as siblings, lovers, etc... What kind of family should we be?"
我曾经认为这只是一种安慰，直到我被召唤到这个世界上，自己成为神明为止。,I used to think prayers were simply a way for mortals to comfort ourselves. But then the gods saved me and transformed me into what I am today.
是啊，也有不少麻烦是神明弄出来，最后由人类解决的呢！,"Yes, the gods have caused many problems in the world, leaving humans to clean up behind them."
是啊，我的同伴还有十一个，不过她们好像被某种不同时空的力量封印住了。,"Yes, I have eleven more companions, but they seem to be sealed by power from a different time and space."
你这么做没啥意义，因为我的同伴中并不是所有人都像我这么能打……,"It doesn't make sense for you to do this, because not all of my companions are good at fighting like me..."
哼哼……其实我只是冲着有架可打才回应你的喔！,"Hum...Actually, I only responded to you when there is a fight!"
其实在被召唤来这里之前，我每天的生活都很单纯，因为只要把贡品吃光就行啦！,"In fact, before I was summoned to this place, I lived a simple life, because I just need to eat up the tribute!"
那得看记什么东西啦！如果是好吃的美食，我能把整本菜谱都记下来！,"It depends on the things! If it is delicious food, I can memorize the entire recipe!"
这样太没亲近感啦！人家可不希望在约会的时候叫这么没情调的称呼呢！,This is too alienated! I don't want to call such an unromantic name when we are dating!
哎呀……是么？可力气太大的话，会不会太没有女孩子的气质了……？,"Ah...Really? But if there is too much strength, will it be too lack of girly...?"
哟……你好像在质疑我的力量？要不要今晚来我的房间……和我比试比试？,Well... You seem to be questioning my power? Do you want to come to my room tonight to...compare with me?
信仰确实是可以汇聚成神力的呢！强大的神明不也是这样才诞生的吗？,Beliefs can indeed converge into divine power! Isn't it the same way that powerful gods were born?
怎么会！看看你的同伴，你就是他们的信仰，这种信仰的力量可是无人能挡的呢！,"It is! Look at your companions, you are their belief. The power of this belief is unstoppable!"
我从来没想过自己也有和别人签订爱之契约的那一天呢！事先说明，我可绝对没有偷偷朝你射箭喔，这一切都是命运的安排！,"I never thought I'd see the day when I would give my heart to another! I swear I never shot one of my arrows at you. It was fate, and fate alone!"
哼……看在你这么真诚的份上，我就收下你这束结缘的百合花好了……等等！你……你这满脸的得意算什么啊！我们的身份还是有高低的！,"Hmph... Because of your sincerity, I accept these flowers. ... Wait! I see that proud look on your face! Don't forget that I still retain my independence!"
诗人们常说“我们都是一只翅膀的天使，只有相互拥抱着才能飞翔”，今天我总算明白这句诗的含义了，今后我将与你面对共同的命运！,"A poet once wrote: We are all angels with only one wing, we can only fly by embracing each other. Today, I finally understand what they mean. From now on, we will face our destiny together."
我曾以为越是拥有寒冰般坚硬的内心，就能够变得越加强大。但你让我明白了真正的强大实际是彼此信赖的感情，以及不可斩断的羁绊。,"I used to think that having a cold, hard heart made me stronger. But you helped me see the true strength of a mutual and unbreakable bond."
啊啦……你终于无法抗拒混沌的魅力，而向我渴求这份象征永恒的誓约了吗？真是个性急的家伙，但这份直率也是你最大的优点呢！,"Ahh... I see you can't resist the charm of chaos. You seem eager for this eternal vow and what it represents. You are so direct and eager, but these are also great strengths!"
今晚月色格外地美，不是么？能和你在满月的日子交换彼此的誓约，实在是一件值得在永恒时光中，慢慢回忆的幸事……,"The moonlight is really beautiful tonight, isn't it? Exchanging vows with you on the night of a full moon is a blessing that will always be worth remembering."
如同坚守彩虹桥那样，我必将坚守彼此所许下的诺言，以北欧众神的荣耀起誓，此生我会与你共同面对一切命运的考验！,"Just like my devotion to Bifrost, I will not waiver in my vow to you. I swear by the glory of the Nordic gods that from henceforth, we shall face all the trials of destiny together!"
作为与我结下永恒誓约、我唯一认可的强者而言，你还是太年轻了，但我挺乐意在以后漫长的日子里，好好和你分享作为统治者的经验。,"I recognize your courage. Despite your youth, you are the only person brave enough to make an eternal vow with me. In the years ahead, I will happily share my experience as a ruler with you."
人类在在待彼此羁绊的时候还真有仪式感……观察你这么长时间后我不得不承认，对你的感情……确实是一种难以用理性去分析的东西。,"You humans really do make a ritual of marriage. After observing you for so long, I've found that I have feelings for you that are difficult to analyze rationally."
这份誓约指的是一辈子和你在一起么？我倒是挺乐意的，不过……我希望你不会介意每顿饭都吃烤肉的日子，哼哼……,"Does this vow mean we will be together for our entire lives? That's wonderful, but... I hope you like eating barbecue for every meal."
没有什么比这份永恒的誓约更让我感到高兴的了，我会作为光明的化身，一直为你驱散黑暗，直至太阳不再升起的那一天到来……,"Nothing makes me happier than this eternal vow. As the incarnation of light, I promise to drive away the darkness for you until the day the sun no longer rises."
连接灵魂的永恒誓约喵？那是什么喵？可以吃喵？你说只要签了这份契约就有吃不完的小鱼干喵？！主人你真是太温柔了喵！爱死你了喵！,"An eternal vow to bind our souls? *meow* What is that? Is it edible? If I accept, will there be plenty of dried fish? *meow* But you are so kind and gentle, I believe what you do is good for me. *meow* "
即使没有这份誓约，我也早已把你当作家人般看待了，但我很欣慰你愿意与我建立起这永恒的羁绊，愿水神护佑我最重要的家人……,"Even before this vow, you were like family to me. I am very grateful for this eternal bond between us. May the Goddess of Water protect you, the most important member of my family."
我与你的誓约也是一种魔法，但这种魔法除了用爱与信任作为魔力外，没有任何方式能够启动……你知道这意味着什么吗？,My vow with you is also a kind of magic which only the sacred power of love and trust can activate. Do you understand?
每天夕阳落下之时，我都在期待将来会是谁在这里和我签下永恒的誓约，而如今命运已有了结果，在今后相处的日子里，请多多指教……,"Every day at sunset, I dreamed of finding the one who would make an eternal vow with me. Now destiny has brought you to me. I hope we can live happily together in the days to come."
回报：与我共享永恒的生命，代价：你的灵魂将永远在深不见底的冥界陪伴我。呵呵……你明白这份契约的内容……意味着什么吧？,"You will now spend all eternity with me, but at a cost: We shall reside together in the underworld. Haha! Did you know these details before you made your vow?"
作为敢和我这名死神签定永恒誓约的人类来说，你胆子真是够大。但不可否认，我会很期待今后每一晚和你相拥而眠的时光……,You are a very brave human to make an eternal vow with me--the god of death. I look forward to sleeping each night in your arms.
万象离合是大自然的循环，彼此灵魂的结合也同样是大自然最珍贵的祝福，不管这场末日持续多久，我与你的誓约都将如磐石般永恒。,"Partings and reunions are part of nature's cycle, and spiritual bonds are its most precious blessing. I will not let this apocalypse weather my commitment. My vow to you will be as eternal as stone."
我早已习惯伴随着正义而来的孤独，但你的灵魂却让我感受到了一种亲切，或许在将来的命运之路上，有你的陪伴也是个不错的选择。,"I am accustomed to the loneliness imposed by justice. I am grateful for the kindness you bring to my life. Perhaps, I made a good choice with you."
在订立誓约的这一刻，我可以感受到你灵魂的光辉，你的勇气足以胜过英灵殿任何一位英雄，能够永远在战场上伴随你是我无上的荣耀！,I could feel the radiance of your soul the moment you made your vow. You are more courageous than any hero in Valhalla. It is my eternal honor and joy to accompany you on the battlefield.
你真是太坏了……以前从没有说过愿意和我结下誓约的话……但身为缘结神，直到今天才明白你的感情，我也是个迟钝的家伙呢……,You are so sly! You never hinted that you might want to make a vow with me. All this time I misunderstood your intentions. I'm so bad at these things.
誓约？嗯……我原本并不特别在意言语或是仪式上的誓言，但我至少能向你保证，我会一直守护你，直至诸神的黄昏再次降临。,"A vow? Hmm... I'm not one for romance or rituals, but I promise to continue guarding you until Ragnarök comes."
哎？你说一旦签下这份契约，我就永远回不去自己的世界了？嗯……其实我觉得和你相处这么长时间后……留在这个世界陪你也挺高兴……,"Once we make this vow to each other, will I never be able to return to my own world? Hmm... We have gotten along well together. I probably wouldn't mind staying here in your world with you."
你知道吗？我倾听过无数的愿望，送出过无数件礼物，但这份与你所定的誓约，在我看来却比世界上任何一件礼物都珍贵！,"I have listened to countless wishes and sent countless gifts, but this vow with you is more precious to me than any gift in the world! Did you know that?"
嗯……愿意和我这名普通的妖怪签下这么重要的誓约，我还是挺意外的，愿大和的神明降下幸福的恩赐，愿我们的默契守护彼此的灵魂。,"I'm shocked that you were willing to make a sacred vow with me, an ordinary monster. May the Yamato gods bless us with happiness and protect our souls."
签订契约与打造武器一样，都需要灌注信任与心血，尽力去达成彼此的理念，我的誓言将化为最锋利的剑与最坚固的盾，始终为你而战！,Making our vows is like crafting equipment. It requires hard work and determination. I vow henceforth to be your sharpest sword and your strongest shield!
呵呵……你知道么？无数的恶魔、邪神甚至天使，都曾经将这份誓约书送到我面前，但你是唯一让我真心愿意在上面签下真名的人类……,"Ha! Did you know that countless demons, devils, and angels have offered their vows to me? But you are the only human to make me genuinely willing to accept?"
什……什么呀！我才不是因为喜欢你才和你定下这份誓约的呢！我只是觉得你这个家伙运气太差，要是没有我帮忙就会倒霉透顶而已！,"You should know that I made this vow with you only because you seem very unlucky. Without my help, your luck will only get worse!"
从古至今我很少立誓言，但每当我们在一起时，我却总希望时间能流逝得再慢一些，这种对你的期待，或许已经超过最坚定的誓言了吧。,"From ancient times to the present, I seldom make vows. But whenever we're together, I find myself wanting time to pass more slowly. I have never been so firm in my vows before."
即使来自不同的时空，神明的机缘依旧让我们相遇，这实在是幸福的事情……啊，对了！如果不介意的话，我能拍张照片留念吗？,"We come from entirely different worlds. I can't believe the gods allowed us to meet! Oh, by the way, would you mind if we took a picture as a souvenir?"
没有什么比誓约更让我感到安心，无论是神界还是黄泉，能和值得依靠的人共同面对这永恒的时光，身为神明的我也毫无遗憾了。,"Nothing makes me feel more at ease than an eternal vow. Whether it is in heaven or the netherworld, I, as a god, have no regrets about spending eternity with someone worthy of my trust."
啊啦……这么渴求和我定下这份誓约……是觉得彼此作为导师与学生的关系已经不能满足你了吗？看来你也是个耐不住寂寞的家伙呢……,You seem very eager to make this vow with me. Are you no longer satisfied with our mentor-student relationship? You seem like someone who can't handle being alone.
我很庆幸能够与你定下这份永恒的誓约，我永远会在你需要我时，与你共同面对一切，愿你能一如既往地信赖大地赐予的力量。,I am grateful for this eternal vow. I will always be there for you when you need me. Always trust in the power bestowed by the earth.
哼哼！在定下这份誓约后，每天我都会用拳头好好地训练你的战斗技巧！毕竟，我还是希望能够在战场上守护好彼此的身后。,"Humph! This vow won't excuse you from our daily training sessions and the fury of my fists. After all, we must be prepared to guard each other's backs on the battlefield."
即使身为胜利女神，我也有过恐惧和不安，但在与你立下的誓约中，我能感受到你灵魂深处的勇气，愿我们二人能够永远引领同伴的胜利。,"Even the goddess of victory suffers from fear and anxiety. But with this vow, I feel courage in the depths of my soul. From now on, we will lead our companions to victory together."
契约是公正的象征，我在你的灵魂中能够感受到正义的光芒，却没有感受到复仇的晦暗，或许我们彼此结合，才能带来真正的秩序。,Our vow is a symbol of justice. I sense the light of justice in your soul instead of the darkness of revenge. Perhaps we can work together to bring true order.
和我立下永恒誓约？呃……你的意思是想被变成石头吗？等……等下！我开玩笑的！其实我只是想看看你惊慌失措的样子而已，嘻嘻……,"Make an eternal vow with me? Uh... do you mean you want to be turned into stone? Wait...wait! I'm just kidding! Actually, I just wanted to watch you panic."
我等这一天很久啦！哎？你怎么一直盯着我看？是在等着我给你一个誓约之吻吗？啊啦……我还是头一次见你的脸红成这样……,I have been waiting for this day for a long time! Hey? Why are you staring at me? Are you hoping for a kiss? Haha... This is the first time I've seen you blush.
这份永恒誓约意味着彼此灵魂与信仰的结合，我曾经经历过无数危难与考验，而如今你与我同在，这场末日浩劫必将在我们手中结束！,"This eternal vow is a union of our souls and beliefs. I have experienced countless dangers and trials, and now that you are with me, we will surely end this apocalyptic catastrophe."
签订誓约时为对方献上美妙的歌曲是海妖一族的传统，不过我担心在这里唱的话你会幸福得晕过去……还是晚上我们独处时再唱给你听吧！,"Traditionally, sirens sing when making their vows. But I am worried you would faint from happiness if I were to sing here and now. I should wait until the evening when we are alone."
好吧……虽然作为掌管梦境的女神，我曾在梦里幻想过很多次这样的场景，但没想到在现实中，你会真的愿意和我签定这份永恒的誓约……,"As the goddess of dreams, I have dreamt of this many times before. But I never imagined that you would be so willing to make an eternal vow with me in reality."
每次在见到你时我总会想到，随着生命的流逝我们终将人神两隔，但签下誓约的这一刻我无比欣慰，因为你的青春将永远与我同在。,I know that someday the end of your life will separate us. You are but a mere mortal. Yet I am still happy to make this vow. You will remain young in my heart forever.
虽然我的力量至今仍沉睡在深海的某个角落，但当你我共同定下这份永恒的誓约时，是否能够找回那份力量，似乎也变得不那么重要了呢。,"I worry that I may never regain my powers, which sleep in the depths of the sea. But when sharing this vow with you, that concern seems far less important."
黑夜曾经是人类最恐惧的存在之一，但你我彼此定下这份誓约之后，黑夜将不再是封闭你目光的枷锁，而是守护你身影的坚盾。,"Humans used to fear the darkness of night. But now that we have made our vow, the night will no longer cause you to cower in fear. Instead, it will serve as a shield to protect you."
虽然作为众神信使，任何事情上我都希望能快人一步，但你不觉得我们关系的发展……快得有些离谱了吗？我兴奋得心脏都快跳出来了……,"As a messenger for the gods, I like to be one step ahead of everything. But don't you think our relationship is moving... too fast? I'm so excited that my heart is jumping out of my chest!"
我曾经并不认为誓约有什么意义，因为时间终将带走一切，但我在你灵魂的音律中，听见了希望与我一起面对永恒的承诺……,"I used to think vows were nonsense because everything fades with time. However, your soul resonates with mine, for you hope to face eternity with me."
与我定下永恒的誓约么？呵呵……真是个奇怪的人类呢……不过我挺高兴能有人分担审判亡者的工作，以及陪我打发无聊的午后……,"An eternal vow with me? Haha... What a strange human... But I would appreciate spending our time together judging the dead. It's such a boring task, and I would love to share the work."
从与你相遇的那天，我就已经预见到了与你定下誓约的这一刻，既定的命运总是让人感到无趣，但与你命运的交汇，却给了我不少的惊喜。,"I have foreseen this moment since the day I met you. Destiny can be so boring, but you bring a lot of surprises."
如同繁茂的大树与坚实的泥土一般，我们的誓约是彼此灵魂最紧密的依靠，无论何时我都会像大地一样尽全力保护你。,"Our vows create a dependence between our souls, much like that between lush trees and nourishing soil. I will always do my best to protect you like the earth."
啊……如果和你签定这份契约的话，不就意味着莉莉丝以后只能当你一个人的偶像了吗？！真是令人头痛的选择呢！,"Ah... If I make this vow, does it mean that I only belong to you? But I want to be everyone's sweet heart!"
通过誓约而连接的灵魂，其实和药物调制是一样的道理，即使只是两种寻常的药材，在调配到一起的时候，也是能混合出不小的奇迹呢。,"The union of two souls through a vow is like preparing medicine. When blended, two ingredients, no matter how common, can create a miracle."
即使是一片树叶，一丛花朵也能给自然带来属于自己的能量，即使我失去了掌控大地的能力，但我依旧会在战场上为你而全力以赴。,"Even a leaf or a bunch of flowers can release nature's energy. Although my ability to control the earth fades, I will still do my best to support you in battle."
哼……虽然我对和正义阵营的家伙定誓约没什么兴趣，不过与你相处的这些时间里，至少你能证明自己的强大，以及……对我的好感……,"Hmph... I am not interested in making a vow with someone aligned with justice. However, you have proven your strength, and that interests me..."
与人类定下誓约，确保她们不堕入邪道，是天使们的职责，愿我与你灵魂的融合带来勇气与智慧，愿我对你的爱驱散末日带来的恐惧。,"Angels must make vows with humans to ensure they do not stray down an evil path. May our spiritual bond bring you courage and wisdom, and may my love for you dispel your fear."
哼哼！你竟然选择了我作为誓约对象，我还是挺惊讶的呢！虽然我不能带给你永恒的生命，但我保证会把你做成全世界最漂亮的木乃伊！,"Wow! I'm surprised that you chose to make a vow with me! Although I cannot give you eternal life, I promise to make you the most beautiful mummy in the world!"
啊啦……能够得到你的认同，与你定下永恒的誓约，我很开心呢！不过我身边的这头小可爱似乎对这件事……呃……有点意见……,Awwww...I am very happy to earn your approval and make an eternal vow with you! But this little cutie next to me seems...er.. not pleased about this...
誓约？我们种族对这些没什么概念……不过从和你定下誓约后，我们在战斗时能默契地把敌人打飞这件事来说，还是挺方便的呢！,"Vows? My race does not make these. But if I make one with you, we can fight together to defeat our enemies in battle. How convenient!"
定不定誓约或许对我们并没有什么太大的影响，因为我们对彼此早已无比信任了。但我还是为那份从你灵魂深处传来的温柔而感到欣慰……,"We have already placed our trust in each other, so a vow is irrelevant. Still, I am pleased with the gentleness that comes from the depths of your soul."
“愿誓约连接彼此的命运 ，愿我们的灵魂永不分离，直至世界尽头的永恒。”你看这段誓词写得怎么样？！我可足足想了一整晚呢！！,May our vows unite our destinies. May our souls stay united until the end of the world. ... What do you think of that vow? I wrote it last night!
我还记得在末日降临时，自己是第一次回应一名凡人的召唤，或许神明注定要我们相遇，共同背负解决这场末日浩劫的使命。,"I still remember when this apocalypse began and, for the first time, I answered the call of a mortal. Perhaps we were meant to resolve this catastrophe together."
嗯……我其实想知道当初你第一次召唤天使时，看到我之后的感受？,Hmm... I actually wonder how you felt when you saw me after you first summoned an angel?
啊……身为鱼类这个种族，陆地上的生活让人家很不适应呢！,"Ah...As a species of fish, life on land is very uncomfortable for me!"
当我能化身为人形的时候，还挺担心自己的身材是不是会太胖呢！,"When I was able to incarnate into a human form, I was worried about whether my figure would be too fat!"
有兴趣陪我晒晒太阳吗？,Are you interested in basking with me?
战争是最愚蠢的一种行为了……无论哪里只要一开战，生灵都要遭殃。,"War is the most stupid thing... No matter where, as long as a war starts, all creatures will suffer."
嗯……你觉得神与妖怪有何不同呢？,Hmm...what do you think is the difference between gods and monsters?
爱情是世界上最神秘的存在，很多战争开始于它，也结束于它……,"Love is the most mysterious existence in the world. Many wars begin with it, and end with it..."
你喜欢猫这种动物么？你觉得猫的性格怎么样？,Do you like animals like cats? What do you think of the cat's character?
坦白地说，我并不反感战争，它带来了破坏和杀戮，但也带来了勇气与荣耀。,"Frankly speaking, I am not disgusted with war. It brings destruction and killing, but it also brings courage and glory."
战争或许会让自然遭受短暂的痛楚，但却能让新生的生命重新焕发光芒。,"War may cause nature to suffer short-term pain, but it can bring brightness to new life."
神明与人类的最大区别是勇气与责任感，你不这么认为吗？,"The biggest difference between gods and humans is courage and responsibility, don't you think so?"
带领战死的北欧英雄们去往英灵殿，这是一种使命，也是一种艺术。,Leading the Nordic heroes who died in battle to Valhalla is a mission as well as an art.
礼物其实是很神圣的东西呢，你觉得礼物能够给人们带来什么？,Gifts are actually very holy things. What do you think gifts can bring to people?
我其实并不认为神明和人类在身份上应该有高低之别，你觉得呢？,"Actually, I don't think that gods and humans should be different in terms of their identities. What do you think?"
我其实挺喜欢小孩子的，他们总会用天真单纯的心思去面对事物。,I actually like children very much. They always face things with simple and naive minds.
呵……对于这个战争四起的末日，或许和平就是最好的礼物了吧？,"Alas...for this doomsday with wars, perhaps peace is the best gift, right?"
你有想要的礼物吗？圣诞节的时候要不要我送你一个惊喜？,What kind of gift do you like to receive? Would you like me to give you a surprise at Christmas?
其实，礼物送出去前，我自己也不知道礼物袋子里拿出来的会是什么东西……,"Actually, before the gift is given out, I don't know what things will be taken out from the gift bag either..."
惊喜？,Surprise?
慌张？,Panic?
太炎热吗？,Is it too hot?
过于干燥？,Is it too dry?
其实你身材很棒！,Actually you have a perfect figure!
好像确实有点……,It seems a bit...
我恐怕没空……,I'm afraid I have no time...
战争是和平之母。,War is the mother of peace.
我认为没有区别。,I think there is no difference.
高傲？,Arrogant?
乖巧？,Docile?
战争过于残酷了。,The war is too cruel.
这是一种重生。,This is a kind of rebirth.
但战争代价很大。,But the price of war is high.
我也这么想。,I agree.
我认为是实力。,I think it is strength.
这职责很神圣。,This duty is very sacred.
我有资格去吗？,Am I qualified to go?
希望？,Hope?
喜悦？,Joy?
我不是很认同。,I don't really agree.
单纯未必是好事。,Being simple is not necessarily a good thing.
我必将结束战争！,I will end the war!
和平并不容易……,Peace is not easy...
嗯，甜美的爱情？,"Hmmm, sweet love?"
哼！强大的力量！,Humph! A tremendous strength!
神秘一点也不错！,Mystery is not bad!
我忽然有点慌……,I feel a bit scared suddenly...
人类尝试新事物的时候总是伴随着一丝喜悦和一丝害怕，在天使看来其实挺有趣的。,"When humans try new things, they are always a bit happy and a bit fearful. In angels' view, it is actually quite interesting."
所幸回应你召唤的是我，而不是米迦勒或是路西法之类的，不然你就有苦头吃了……,"Fortunately, it was me who responded to your summon, not Michael or Lucifer, otherwise you would suffer..."
是啊，就算我穿泳装在沙滩上走过的时候，也能感到无数炽热的目光呢！,"Yeah, even when I walk on the beach in a swimsuit, I can feel countless hot gazes!"
也算是吧，但我可不奢求在这个魔物横行的时代，每天都能洗上热水澡。,"That's right, but I don't have the luxury of asking for a hot bath every day in this era of rampant monsters."
哎呀……看来你比我想象中更懂怎么让女孩子开心呢……这话不是对谁都可以说的喔！,Oops... It seems that you know how to make girls happy more than I expected... Don't say this to anyone please~
不会吧！你是在开玩笑的吧？！如果是真的话我今天就开始减肥！今天就开始！,"No way! Are you kidding me? ! If it is true, I will start losing weight today! Now!"
那么一会儿见！我知道一个非常不错的海滩，可以好好享受一下二人时光呢！,See you soon! I know a very nice beach where we can enjoy our time!
哼哼……是和其他的女孩子有约会吗？看来我来迟一步了呢……,Hum...do you have dates with other girls? It seems that I am a step late...
所以尽快结束这场战争是很重要的事情，我一定会尽全力帮你！,"So it is very important to end this war as soon as possible, and I will definitely do my best to help you!"
或许我们妖怪的想法比较单纯吧，我并不理解你说这句话的内涵……,"Maybe our monster's mind is simple, I don't understand the connotation of what you said..."
不知道就别想啦！至少我更愿意当妖怪，因为从来都不用像神那样担心那么多麻烦事！,"Then stop thinking if you don't know! At least I prefer to be a monster, because I never have to worry about so many troubles like a god!"
呼……我也这么想，大家都是从平凡之身不断磨练，从而获取强大的力量罢了。,"Aha... I think so too, everyone is constantly tempering from the ordinary body to gain powerful strength."
希腊众神当年指使的特洛伊战争，在凡人看来不也是因为一场爱情的缘故吗？,"Wasn't the Trojan war that the Greek gods instigated, in the eyes of mortals, also because of love?"
当你有了心上人，且愿意为她对抗这个世界的时候，或许你才能明白吧……,"When you have a sweetheart and are willing to fight the world for her, maybe you can understand..."
的确，猫看似优雅温顺，但自尊心丝毫不逊于那些猛兽，惹恼它们可就大事不妙了。,"Indeed, cats seem elegant and docile, but their self-esteem is not inferior to those beasts, and it is a bad thing to annoy them."
看来你很懂得如何取得这些小家伙的认同呢，能让它们变得乖巧可不是容易事！,It seems that you know how to get the approval of these little cuties. It's not easy to make them docile!
是啊，人们只看见战争灰暗的一面，却很少看到鲜血与刀锋背后的高尚与圣洁。,"Well, people only see the dark side of war, but rarely see the nobility and holiness behind the blood and the blade."
人终有一死，北欧的战士们很多都宁愿光荣地为理想而牺牲，而非平庸地度过一世。,"Though death befalls all men alike, many Nordic warriors would rather sacrifice their lives honorably for their ideals than living their lives in mediocrity."
生与死都是一种轮回，命运也是，爱情也是，战争更是，万事万物都是无常的。,"Life and death are a kind of reincarnation, so is destiny, so is love, and so is war. Everything is impermanent."
其实战争的代价会让人们更珍惜来之不易的和平，不是吗？,"In fact, the price of war will make people cherish the hard-earned peace even more, don't they?"
所以并非什么人都能成为众神的统治者，毕竟统治者所要背负的责任难以言喻。,"Therefore, not everyone can become the ruler of the gods. After all, the responsibility that the ruler has to bear is beyond expression."
你说的其实没错，如果你仔细观察，会发现实力强大的人往往也是勇敢而负责的存在。,"You are right. If you observe carefully, you will find that powerful people are often brave and responsible."
是的，无论是我还是英灵殿的女武神们都以此为自己的荣耀！,"Yes, both I and the Valkyries in Valhalla take this as their glory!"
目前没有，至少你在战场上英勇牺牲前不行，但……我可不希望看到这一天的到来……,"Not at the moment, at least you can't go until you die on the battlefield, but...I don't want to see this day come..."
是啊，没有比在失落或伤心之时，收到一份温暖的爱更让人振奋的事情了。,"Yep, there is nothing more exciting than receiving a warm love when you are upset or sad."
的确如此，我没见过有哪个孩子，在见到一大堆的糖果后不开心到满地打滚的。,Indeed. I have never seen a child who doesn't roll all over the floor happily after receiving a lot of candies.
所以，不管你是凡人还是神明，我们都不必过于拘谨地对待彼此，你说呢？,"So, whether you are a mortal or a god, we don't have to treat each other too rigidly, right?"
对于我来说没什么区别，因为在我送礼物时，可不会因为身份的高低而偏心喔！,"It doesn't make a difference to me, because when I give gifts, I won't be biased because of status!"
我倒觉得想太多烦恼也多，在这个末日降临的世界，或许单纯地过好每一天也不错。,"I think worries will increase when thinking more, in this doomsday world, maybe it's not bad to simply live each day well."
一点没错！孩子们从来不去想明天会不会就是世界末日，他们总是乐观看待一切。,That's right! Children never think about whether tomorrow will be the end of the world. They always look at everything optimistically.
我可以感受到你的决心，如果你真的能做到，我就送你一件全世界最珍贵的礼物。,"I can feel your determination. If you can really do it, I will give you the most precious gift in the world."
不用过于悲观，和平总是诞生在人们的希望和期待中，哪怕降临的很慢……,"Don't be too pessimistic, peace is always born in people's hopes and expectations, even if it comes slowly..."
啊啦……你……你的意思是想让我把自己当作礼物送给你吗？,"Ahhhhh...do you mean...you want me, as a gift?"
满足你啦！只要让我每次和你一起出战，就已经是最强大的组合了呢!,"Ok, will satisfy you! As long as I go with you for battle every time, it is already the most powerful combination!"
就是这样！满怀期待地享受在拆开礼物盒前的那份惊喜，也是一种乐趣！,That's it! It is also a pleasure to enjoy the surprise before opening the gift box!
啊啦……你的表情让我很想欺负一下呢！猜猜看，这个盒子里是什么恶作剧……？,Ahhh... your expression makes me want to bully you! Guess what prank is in this box...?

对敌方随机发出6枚炎弹，每次造成90%的物理伤害，如果目标处于【燃烧】或【灼烧】状态，则伤害转化为真实伤害，每一枚炎弹会给敌方施加一层【怒焰】标记（无视异常免疫，可以叠加），每层标记会使目标受到的炎弹伤害提高50%（单体总伤害最高为1215%），【怒焰】标记持续1回合。,"Throws up 6 firebombs randomly to enemies, each attack causing 90% P.DMG. If the enemy is in [Ignite] or [Scorch] state, the damage will be converted into True Damage. Each firebomb will add one [Infuriation] mark (ignoring Debuff RES, can stack), each mark will increase the firebomb's ATK by 50%. ( The max ATK of one firebomb is 1215%) [Infuriation] mark lasts for 1 round."
是否使用一枚幻想星戒与女神誓约,Are you sure you want to use a Magic Star Ring to vow to the angel?
呐，姐姐！我发现自己的火焰忽然比以前炽热了好几倍！,"Hey, sister! I found that my flame was suddenly hotter several times than before!"
从魔力的变化看来，你应该获得了和我类似的力量。,"Judging from the change in magic power, you should have gained power similar to mine."
全新的觉醒之力么？天哪……你这眼神让我有不好的预感……,"A new power of awakening? OMG... Look at your eyes, that makes me have a bad feeling..."
姐姐你猜对啦！我早就想试试新的力量了！来打一架吧！,"Sister, you are right! I have long wanted to try new powers! Let's fight!"
快停手！我们认输了！,Stop it! We surrendered!
不会吧？！我才刚刚做完热身运动而已！,No way? ! I just finished warming up!
我感到你的力量需要不断与强者战斗，才能完全被唤醒。,I feel that your power needs to constantly fight the strong to be fully awakened.
这可真是一件让人兴奋的事情！,This is really an exciting thing!
等一下！我的意思不是让你到别的神明那里去惹麻烦！,Wait! I don't mean to let you in trouble with other gods!
哎？我听说女娲神殿门口有魔物入侵……怎么是你？,"Uh, I heard that there is a monster invading at the gate of Nuwa temple...Why it's you?"
啊……说我是魔物我也不在意啦，来打架吧！,Well... I don't care if I am described as a monster. Let's fight!
喔哟？我最近拳头发痒，正愁没什么惹事的家伙可以揍呐！,"Huh? I just want to use my fists, wondering if there is someone who caused trouble to let me beat!"
那就不要废话啦！痛快地打一场比什么都重要！,Then stop speaking rubbish! A good fight is more important than anything else!
咳咳……没想到身为火神的我，竟然会输给你的烈焰。,"Ahem... I didn't expect that as the god of fire, I would lose to your flames."
真是太无趣了！我原以为要打上好几天才能分出胜负！,It's so boring! I thought it would take several days to know who is the winner!
依我来看，或许只有主神级的强者或许才能和你一战。,"In my opinion, perhaps only the powerhouse of the main god-level be able to fight you."
真的？！那我去找奥丁老大较量较量！回头见！,Really? ! Then I'll go to boss Odin and fight with her! See you later!
喔哟，她竟然真的相信了，这下有戏看喽，哈哈……,"Oh, she actually believed it. There will be funny things, haha..."
老大！我来找你打架啦！哎？太阳神大人也在啊……,"Hi, boss! I'm coming to fight with you! Oh, you are here too, sun god..."
啊啦……这不是奥丁最宠爱的那只脾气火爆的小可爱么？,Ah... Isn't this the hot-tempered cutie that Odin loves the most?
北欧龙族也能拥有如此强大的潜力，倒是挺让我意外的……,I am surprised that the Nordic dragons can also have such a strong potential...
看你满脸兴奋，是不是想让太阳神姐姐好好疼爱你一番了？,Look at your exciting face. Do you want the sun god to fight with you?
那真是求之不得的事情呢！,That's really a most welcome thing!
哼……看来你觉醒了不得了的力量啊……,Huh... It seems that you have awakened an incredible power...
太阳的光辉似乎都无法遮盖你的烈焰，这非比寻常……,"The brilliance from sun seems to be unable to cover your flames, this is extraordinary..."
我也没想到能爆发出这种力量，但我也快接近极限了……,"I didn't expect I can burst this strong power, but I am also approaching the limit..."
不过在刚才的战斗中，我似乎察觉到了创世神的魔力。,"But in the battle just now, I seemed to be aware of the magic power of creator goddess."
喔？这可真是个有意思的发现，我会好好调查一下的……,"Oh? This is really interesting discovery, I will investigate it carefully..."

喔！姐姐你看上去好像觉醒了全新的力量？！,"Wow, it seems like you have awakened a new power!"
我……只感觉浑身上下都充满了闪电的狂怒……,I feel like..my body is full of furious lightning...
哦？亲爱的，你终于因为没命地研究魔力而发疯了吗？,"Oh? Honey, are you finally mad for studying magic powers desperately?"
看来只有打一架，才能知道这闪电的力量究竟有多大了！,It seems that only a fight can prove the power of the lightning!
那就没有必要多说什么了！来吧 ！,Then there is no need to say anything more! Come on!
难以置信，你雷电的破坏力似乎和之前相比大幅提升！,It shocks me that the destructive power of your lightning seems to be greatly improved compared to before!
而且无论是冰还是烈焰，似乎都无法对你造成影响。,And probably neither the ice nor the flames can affect you.
在战斗的时候，我好像感觉到雷电帮我形成了一道屏障。,I think that the lightning made a shield for me during the battle.
而这道屏障，应该可以免除所有对你不利的状态。,And this shield should be able to avoid all unfavorable conditions for you.
我还想到了一个能击穿对方防御的新招，或许也可以试试。,"I also thought of a new skill that can penetrate the opponent's defense, maybe I can have a try."
敢挑战我们三位高阶防御者的力量，我应该称赞你的勇气。,"Dare to challenge us three high-level defenders, I should praise your courage."
哼……我可不希望你们认为我还是之前那个不成熟的学者。,Humph...I don't want you to think that I am the immature scholar before.
是吗？那么就让稳重的大地，来领教一下你的闪电吧。,Are you? Then let the steady earth come to confront your lightning.
还没有谁的攻击，能洞穿我号称北欧最强守护者的防御。,No one's attack can penetrate the defense of what I claim to be the strongest guardian in Norse.
是吗？！那么就让你们见识一下，击溃一切的雷暴吧！,Really? ! Then let you guys see the thunderstorm that crush everything!
令人惊讶，这雷电竟然能让人浑身颤抖，无法专注防御……,"Surprisingly, this thunderstorm can make people tremble all over, unable to focus on defense..."
呵……看来强大的盔甲在面对这种雷暴时，也无能为力。,Hum... It seems that the powerful armor is powerless when facing this kind of thunderstorm.
在我看来，这种雷暴还能够形成大范围的爆炸。,"In my opinion, this kind of thunderstorm can also form a large-scale explosion."
的确，相比过去的自己，我感到攻守兼备是最佳的策略。,"Indeed, compared to my past self, I feel that having both attacking and defense is the best strategy."
哼……我会好好善用觉醒之力，去解决这场末日危机的。,"Hmph... I will make good use of the awakening power, to solve this doomsday crisis."

希腊的入侵者？！给我站住！彩虹桥只为北欧众神所开启！,The invaders of Greece? ! Stop it! The Rainbow Bridge is only opened by the Nordic gods!
（没有回答？这太反常了……但我决不会让入侵者通过！）,(No one answers? This is too abnormal...but I will never let intruders pass!)
呼……好强的压迫力……这就是希腊主神的力量吗……,Phew... What a strong oppressive force... Is this the power of the main Greek god...
等等！为什么他们的身影开始消失了？！这是幻象？！,What! Why did their figure begin to disappear? ! Is this an illusion? !
哟，不但防守滴水不漏，还能让对方彻底失去恢复能力……,"Oh, not only is the defense drip-proof, but it can also completely lose the ability of the opponent to recover..."
什么人？！我可没兴趣和躲起来的懦夫说话！,who are you? ! I'm not interested in talking to a coward who is hiding!
嘻嘻，你比诸神黄昏时更强了，给你一个更大的挑战吧……,"Haha, you are stronger than the gods at dusk, there is a bigger challenge for you..."
呵……能把奥丁老大的幻象召唤出来的家伙，只有你了吧？,"Heh...Are you the only one who can summon the illusion of Odin's, right?"
哎呀，没想到我这么出名吗？要不要给你签个名？,"Oh, didn’t you expect me to be so famous? Do you want to sign your name?"
没人对你那肮脏的名字感兴趣，邪神洛基。,"No one is interested in your dirty name, Cthulhu Loki."
嘴硬的家伙，让我看看你的战术是否像你的防御一样可靠！,"Hard-mouthed guy, let me see if your tactics are as reliable as your defense!"
这怎么可能，奥丁强大的攻击竟然没有击倒任何一人？！,How is this possible that Odin's powerful attack didn't knock down anyone? !
让你意外了？是不是觉得自己的脑子不大可靠了？,Is this out of your guess? Do you think your brain is unreliable anymore?
没想到你能用号角链接同伴的灵魂，替他们承担攻击……,"Unexpectedly, you can use the horn to link the souls of your companions and take the attack on their behalf..."
你永远也别想在我倒下前，击倒我的同伴！,You never want to knock down my companions before I fall down!

至今为止，还无人能抵挡北欧龙族中进攻如此凶狠的角色！,"So far, no one can resist such a fierce attacking role among the Nordic dragons!"
你麻烦大了，我倒要见识见识运气是否总站在你那边！,"You are in big trouble, but I want to see if luck is always on your side!"
所有人保持阵型！不要慌乱！,Everyone stays in formation! Don't panic!
这没可能……你的力量以前从来没有如此强大过……,This is impossible... Your power has never been so strong before...
神也是会成长的呐，我很期待把你打趴下的那一刻。,God will grow up and I look forward to the moment when I beat you down.
哼！别得意太早！这次的失败只是我计划的一次实验罢了！,This failure is just an experiment I planned! I will be succussful!
在我看来你的计划恐怕要提前破产了，只要我还活着。,"In my opinion, your plan may be bankrupt in advance, as long as I am still alive."
计划实施的那天，我会好好享受你的恐惧，走着瞧吧！,"When the plan is implemented, I will enjoy your fears, let’s just take a look!"

晶矿大师,Spar Mine Master
当进驻晶石之泉时，提升晶石的产量。,"When stationed at spar spring,increasing the productivity of spar"
伊薇特是最早一批从沉睡中醒来的半人马贤者，也是最早发现晶石矿在建筑上能发挥奇特功效的幻兽。她非常熟悉大自然，能够根据丰富的经验和对大地魔法的掌控，让泉水中所产的晶石矿藏更为富饶。她很反感战争，但并不意味着自己不善于战斗，不过她还是很庆幸幻兽们能享受难得的和平。,"Yvette was one of the first among the group of centaur sages to wake up from their deep sleep, and the first to discover that the crystal mine had a special architectural effect. She is very familiar with nature, and can make crystals produced in the spring water richer based on her rich experience and mastery of earth magic. She is very disgusted with war, but it does not mean that she is not good at fighting. After all, she feels very fortunate that the Eudemons can enjoy the rare peace."
火焰亲和,Flame Affinity
当进驻熔岩池时，提升强化精华的产量。,"When stationed at lava lake, increasing the productivity of Enhance Essence"
作为不死鸟的家族成员之一，妮菲塔莉是少有的不畏惧火焰的种族。正是因为这种能力，只有她能从火山口炽热的熔岩中提炼出额外的强化精华，她也一直以此为傲。虽然看上去很年幼，但没人知道她活了多久，据说她大部分时间都在沉睡，所以心理年龄更像孩子。,"As a member of the Phoenix family, Nefertari is among one of the few races that is not afraid of flames. It is precisely because of this ability that only she can extract extra Enhance Essence from the hot lava of the volcano, and she has always been proud of it. Although she looks very young, no one knows how long she has lived. It is said that she has been asleep most of the time, so her mental age is more like a child."
神核祷文,Holy Core Prayer
当进驻神核祭坛时，提升神核的产量。,"When staioned at holy core altar, increasing the productivity of holy core"
艾琳诺本身就拥有接近神明的可怕力量，正是这一点让她能够做到很多神明都无法企及的事。例如，她可以通过强大的魔力，向更高位的神明祈祷，从而创造出无比珍贵的神核。艾琳诺虽然出身于黑暗无比的深渊，但对任何人都非常温柔，有着大姐姐一般的成熟魅力。,"Eleanor herself has the terrifying near-divine power, and this allows her to do things that many gods can't match. For example, she can pray to higher gods through powerful magic power, thereby creating extremely precious holy cores. Although Eleanor was born in a dark abyss, she is very gentle to anyone and has the mature charm of a big sister."
钻石巧匠,Diamond Craft
当进驻宝石矿山时，提升宝石的产量。,"When staioned at gem mine, increasing the productivity of gem"
芬妮尔性格虽然看上去粗枝大叶，但对钻石这种艺术品的熟悉程度却远超其他人，她总能找到更好的钻石矿。除了精于寻找矿脉外，她还很擅长于钻石的切割与制作，尤其是使用自己锐利的爪子进行这项工作时。她沿用了北欧先祖的名号，是个不折不扣的好战分子，同时，她也是个容易满足于酒宴和派对的家伙。,"Although Fenrir's character looks careless, she is far more familiar with diamonds than others, and she can always find better diamonds. In addition to being good at finding ore veins, she is also very good at cutting and making diamonds, especially when using her sharp claws for this work. She inherited the name of the Nordic ancestors. She was an out-and-out militant, but also could easily indulge in banquets and parties."
宝石炼金术,Gem Alchemy
当进驻炼金工房时，提升钻石的产量。,"When staioned at Atelier, increasing the productivity of diamond"
只有雪樱这样已经生存了几千年的妖怪，才能运用不为人知的炼金技巧，从普通矿石中精炼出宝石。作为高贵的九尾狐一族，雪樱并不在意自己的身份，她很乐意看到自己的成果得到认可，并派上用场。和其他热衷于战争的族人不同，雪樱对战争很反感，她会毫不犹豫地与追求和平的人达成同盟。,"Only monsters like Yukizakura, who have survived for thousands of years, can use unknown alchemy techniques to refine gems from ordinary ore. As a member of the noble nine-tailed foxes family, Yukizakura doesn't care about her identity. She is happy to see her achievements being recognized and put to use. Unlike others who are keen on war, Yukizakura is very disgusted with war, and she will not hesitate to form an alliance with those who pursue peace."

一种生长于异界的大个果实，能够快速填饱肚子，幻兽们格外喜爱。,"Big fruits that grow in another world, which can fill up stomach quickly, Eudemons' favourite."
富含魔力，外表晶莹剔透，如宝石般漂亮的水果，果香浓郁口感清爽，即使是肉食性的幻兽也很喜欢。,"Full of magic power, crystal clear in appearance, beautiful gems-liked fruits. Rich in fruity flavor and refreshing, even carnivorous monsters like it very much."
以龙血浇灌的奇特果实，食用后能够显著提升力量，因无法大量栽种而倍显珍贵。,"The peculiar fruit watered with dragon blood can significantly increase the strength after eating, and it is more precious because it cannot be planted in large quantities."
只生长在第七神域的创世神树上，据说能够大幅提升食用者的寿命，是无价之宝。,"It only grows on the Divine Tree of Creation in the Seventh domain, and it is said to be a priceless treasure that can greatly increase the lifespan of the eater."
鸟类羽毛制作的精美小玩意，挠痒惩罚效果一流，但据幻兽们说，挠多了会上瘾……,"Exquisite gadget made of bird feathers, it has a outstanding effect on tickling, but according to Eudemons, too much tickling will be addictive..."
精巧而结实的粉色丝带，用来系在宠物身上当作装饰，至于系在身体的什么位置上，就得看主人的情调了……,"The delicate and strong pink ribbon is used to tie the pet as a decoration. As for the position on the body, it depends on the master's sentiment..."
点燃后会产生让幻兽恍惚而愉悦的香气，不知是什么原因，此物经常被当作贡品献给创世神……,"After being ignited, it will produce a scent that makes the Eudemons trance and pleasant. For unknown reasons, this thing is often presented as a tribute to the creator…"
有流言称这是创世神亲自发明的宝物，用途不详，但据幻兽们说这东西有一击入魂的快感……,"There are rumors that this is a treasure invented by the creator himself, and its use is unknown, but according to the eudemons, this thing has the pleasure of hitting the soul..."

哎？巴里，这是一扇传送门吧？你知道怎么激活它吗？,"Huh? Bari, is this a portal? Do you know how to activate it?"
啊啦，我怎么会知道，没准你大喊一声“芝麻开门”就成了？,How would I know? Why don't you try yelling Open Sesame?
芝麻开门！！！好吧……我其实早料到你在耍我……,"Open Sesame!!! Alright, I knew you were just pulling my leg…"
然而你还是上当了……等等！为什么这门开始发光了？！,But you still fell for it- Wait! Why is the portal starting to glow!?
有人吗？太好了……没想到几百年后终于能联系到结界外面……,Is anyone there? Thank goodness… To think I've finally managed to contact the world outside the barrier after hundreds of years…
如果有人在另一边……请尽快修复传送门……,If someone is on the other side... please fix the portal as soon as possible…
你听到了吗？！只要修好它就可以知道门那边的秘密了呢！,"Did you hear that?! As long as we fix it, we'll be able to discover the secret at the other side of the portal!"
你为什么眼巴巴地盯着我看！你不会指望我来修这破门吧！,"Why are you staring at me so eagerly!? You don't expect me to fix this broken portal, do you?!"
满足一下我的好奇心嘛，亲爱的，我知道你能把它修好的！,"C'mon, honey. Please fix it for me? I'm dying to know! I know you can do it!"
天哪……为什么我堂堂巫女要替你来做这种事……,"Oh my god… How could I, a grand and magnificent Shrine Maiden, be reduced to doing this for you…"
巴里……门修好了吗？你都修一个星期了，要不要我帮忙？,"Bari...has the portal been fixed? You have been fixing it for a week, would you like me to help?"
不用！如果让你来“帮忙”，这门恐怕几秒后就会散架！,"No need! If I ask you for help, this portal will fall apart in seconds!"
我有这么笨么……等等？门里好像有动静？！,"I'm not that stupid, am I...? Wait! There seems to be movement in the portal? !"
好像接通了，比上次清楚呢！听得到吗？测试！测试！,"It seems to be connected, it's clearer than last time! Can you hear me? Testing! Testing!"
喂喂！巴里，你知道对面是谁吗？！,"Hello? Hello?! Bari, do you know who is that on the other side?!"
不知道，但至少不是魔物，否则你现在已经是个死人了……,"I don’t know, but at least it’s not a monster, otherwise you would be dead by now…"
不用担心，这里是混沌外域，魔物不敢来这里……,"Don't worry, this is Chaos Realm, and the monsters dare not come here..."
混沌外域？巴里你知道这个地方吗？,"Chaos Realm? Bari, do you know this place?"
好像是位于神界之外，一个连创世神也管不着的地方……,"It seems to be located outside the realm of God, a place that even the God of Creation can't control…"
啊，你说对了一半，其实这地方只是个……,"Ah, you are half right, in fact this place is just…"
只是个什么？啊啊啊！怎么断开了！巴里！！快修门！！！,Just what? Ah ah ah! It's disconnected! Bari! ! Hurry! Fix the portal! ! !
巴里……已经半个月了，我做梦都在想门后面是什么……,"Bari... It's been half a month, I'm dreaming about what's behind the portal…"
别急，虽然没完全修复，但也多多少少可以顺利开启了。,"Don't worry, although it hasn't been completely fixed, it can be opened more or less smoothly."
这扇门好像只会响应你的命令，你把手放在门上就能激活。,"This portal seems to only respond to your commands, and you can activate it by putting your hand on the door."
只响应我的命令？还真挺奇怪的……试试看好了，开启吧！！,"Only respond to my orders? It's really weird... Try it, let's turn it on! !"
哟……两个人就能完成修复传送门这件事，真是让人意外呢。,Yo... It's really surprising that two people can complete the repair of the portal.
你没有神明气息但却具有神格……我明白了，你是幻兽吧？,"You don't have the temperament of a god but you have a godhead...I see, you are an Eudemon, right?"
的确如您所言，我们是幻兽，被神明流放的存在……,"Indeed, as you said, we are Eudemons, exiled by the gods…"
幻兽？巴里，幻兽是什么？,"Eudemons? Bari, what is Eudemons?"
神明们的仆从，或是传说中的生物吧？我其实也不大清楚。,"Servants of the gods, or legendary creatures? I actually don't know much."
不管如何，我们都希望能找到从这里出去的方法……因为……,"No matter what, we all hope to find a way out from here…since..."
噢不……连接又断了，看来我们必须把门彻底修好才行。,Oh no... the connection is broken again. It seems that we have to fix the portal thoroughly.
啊……门又坏了，明明之前还能见到门那边的景象……,"Ah... the door is broken again. Previously, we could still see the scene on the other side of the door..."
巴里竟然也偷懒摸鱼去了！真让人生气！开门！开门啊！！,Bari is also lazy too! It's so irritating! Open it! Open it! !
吵死啦！谁在门那边大喊大叫的！是想打架吗？！,It's so noisy! Who is yelling out there! Do you want to fight? !
抱歉……我……我只是想激活传送门，到对面去看看……,Sorry... I... I just want to activate the portal and go to the other side to have a look...
别做梦了！这扇门由于下了阻止进出的结界，没人能通过！,Stop dreaming! No one can pass this portal because of the enchantment that prevents crossing!
阻止进出的结界？你的意思是外人没法通过传送门进去？,Enchantment that prevents crossing? Do you mean that outsiders can't get in through the portal?
是啊！而且门里面的幻兽也没法出来，明白了没？,"Yes! And the Eudemons inside the door can't come out, do you understand?"
你知道是谁下的结界吗？或许我们可以想想办法……,Do you know who created the enchantment? Maybe we can think of a way...
有传闻说是创世神下的，但我觉得没人说得准。,"There are rumors that it was created by the God of Creation, but I think no one can say for sure."
另外！下次开门如果你再大喊大叫……我就把你的头咬下来！,Besides! Next time if you yell again... I'll bite your head off!
你不是刚说这门没法进出吗……,Didn’t you just say that the portal cannot be crossed...
啊！你真够烦的！我不管了啦！我要继续睡午觉了！再见！,Whatever! You are so annoying! I'm going to continue napping! Adiós!
巴里！你看！我成功穿过传送门了呢！,Bari! look! I successfully passed through the portal!
天哪，我觉得你这不要命的性格竟然能活到现在，简直是奇迹。,"My God, I think it's a miracle that you, with that desperate character can survive till now."
确实是奇迹呢，这女孩子是几百年来第一个穿过传送门的人类。,"It’s a miracle indeed, this girl is the first human to pass through the portal in hundreds of years."
看吧！而且我记得你的同伴说过，这扇门任何人都无法穿越。,See! And I remember your companion said that no one can pass through this portal.
其实并非不可穿越，只是穿越时会承受巨大的结界能量。,"In fact, it is not impervious to pass, but it will endure huge enchantment energy when passing through."
令我惊讶的是，你竟然没有像其他人那样被这种能量烧成灰……,What surprises me is that you have not been burnt to ashes by this energy like others…
的确，在我的研究中，这种能量会伤害所有穿过结界的人……,"Indeed, in my research, this kind of energy will hurt everyone who crosses the enchantment…"
除非此人是结界的制造者，但你不可能和这件事有任何关系……,"Unless this person is the creator of the enchantment, but you can't have anything to do with this matter..."
别管那么多啦！我决定了！就算被烧成灰我也要去门那边看看！,"Don't worry about so much! I've made my mind! Even if it is burnt to ashes, I have to go to the otherside to have a look!"
嗯……你准备好就行，我和我的幻兽朋友们会好好招待你的。,"Hmm…As long as you're ready, me and my Eudemon friends and I will treat you well."
真是让我惊讶，我从来没想过这扇门后竟然有个世外桃源。,It really surprised me. I never thought that there was a paradise behind this door.
哟……原来你已经到了啊，我以为你不会来得这么快。,"Yo... So you have already arrived, I thought you wouldn't come so soon."
奴家是此处幻兽们的管理者雪樱，九尾一族的长女，幸会。,"I am Yukizakura, the leader of the Eudemons here, the eldest daughter of the Nine-Tailed clan, pleased to meet you."
幸会！你是上次见面的那位幻兽姐姐啊，哎？只有您一人在？,"Nice to meet you too! You are the Eudemons sister that you met last time, eh? Are you alone?"
嘻嘻……是觉得欢迎你的队伍太短了吗？,Hehe... Do you think the line that welcomes you is too short?
怎么会！只是好奇而已，之前我和很多幻兽们都说过话呢。,"How come! Just curious, I have spoken to many Eudemons before."
那么让我来带路吧，让我把另一位同伴介绍给你。,"Then let me lead the way, and let me introduce another companion to you."
顺便也可以让你熟悉一下这里的环境，我相信你会感兴趣的……,"By the way, I can also familiarize you with this place, I believe you will be interested..."
话说回来，伊薇特，这里好像有很多遗迹一样的建筑。,"By the way, Yvette, there seems to be many ruins-like buildings here."
是的，这就是我之前和你说过的矿物产地，我们正在逐个开启。,"Yes, this is the mine that I told you before, and we are unlocking them one by one."
你看见山顶泉水处的那个遗迹吗？我前几天刚解开它的封印。,Do you see the ruins at the spring on the top of the mountain? I just unlocked it the other day.
它周围的泉水里富含一种晶石矿，是建筑用的重要资源。,"The spring around it is rich in a kind of spar mine, which is an important resource for construction."
很漂亮的遗迹呢！我们去看看吧！,Very beautiful ruins! Let's go check it out!
你看，将晶矿放入遗迹的祭坛上，就可以让遗迹的产能提升。,"You see, putting spar on the altar of the ruins can increase the production capacity of the ruins."
我已经迫不及待想要试试了！,I can't wait to try out!
对了，除了升级遗迹本身外，很多幻兽对遗迹有着独特的知识。,"By the way, in addition to upgrading the ruins themselves, many Eudemons have unique knowledge of the ruins."
如果让她们进驻遗迹之内，也能让遗迹的开采效率更进一步。,"If they are dispatched into the ruins, the mining efficiency of the ruins can be further improved."
例如我，对于晶石之泉已经研究了很久，清楚它的运作原理。,"For example, I have been studying the Spar Spring for a long time, and I know how it works."
嗯，我会尽力寻求其他幻兽们的帮助。,"Well, I will try my best to seek help from other Eudemons."
好啦，剩下的事情以后再说吧，我要去遗迹里开工了，回头见！,"Okay, let's talk about the rest later, I'm going to start work in the ruins, see you later!"
雪樱，这也是传送门吗？看上去和我来时的那扇不大一样……,"Yukizakura, is this also a portal? It looks different from the one I had when I came…"
其实原理差不多，它叫做“寻觅之门”，是我们常用的移动工具。,"In fact, the principle is similar, it is called Gate of seeking, it is our common means of transportation."
你只要思考你想做的事或想见的人，门就会打开合适的通道。,"You just need to think about what you want to do or who you want to meet, and the gate will open the right passage."
这么神奇吗？！这可实在太方便了！,Is it so amazing? ! This is so convenient!
其实并非如此，因为门的能量有限，每天只能开启几次而已。,"In fact, this is not the case, because the energy of the gate is limited and it can only be opened a few times a day."
而且有时候会开错门，可能会把你送到一个莫名其妙的地方。,And sometimes it will open the wrong passage and may send you to an unexplainable place.
我决定先试试，我想找第一次开门时见到的人马姐姐可以吗？,"I decided to try first. I want to find the Centaur sister I saw when I opened the portal for the first time, can I?"
我也不清楚你能不能找到她，看看你的运气如何吧。,I don't know if you can find her. Let's see how lucky you are.
这可真是神明的恩典！没想到第一个穿越结界的竟然是你！,"This is really the grace of the gods! Unexpectedly, you were the first to cross the enchantment!"
既然伊薇特你来了，我就先去忙炼金了，剩下的交给你如何？,"Now that you are here, Yvette, I will go and work on alchemy. How about you leave the rest to you?"
我建议带我们的客人去幻兽之森转转，艾琳诺刚把住处建好。,"I suggest to take our guests to the Forest of Eudemons, Elena has just built the residence."
幻兽之森？那是什么地方？,Forest of Eudemons? What is that place?
是幻兽们的巢穴，等我们到那里了后就明白了。,"It is the lair of the Eudemons, we will understand when we get there."
幻兽之森是我们休息的场所，每一名幻兽都有自己私人的房间。,"The Forest of Eudemons is our resting place, and each Eudemon has its own private room."
挺有趣的，和我们人类的学校宿舍一样？,"Quite interesting, the same as our human school dormitory?"
是的，更重要的是，关系足够好的幻兽是会邀请你进入房间的。,"Yes, more importantly, Eudemons who have good enough relationships with you will invite you into their room"
她们还会与你签订一份同盟契约，帮你做些力所能及的事。,They will also sign an alliance contract with you to help you do what they can.
真的？！我应该如何去和大家处好关系？,For real? ! How should I have a good relationship with everyone?
嗯……通过寻觅之门多找她们聊聊吧，人类是善于沟通的种族。,Hmm... Let’s talk to them more through Gate of seeking. Humans are a race that is good at communicating.
呼，我也有些累了，带你去我的房间喝杯茶吧？,"Phew, I'm also a little tired. Shall I take you to my room for a cup of tea?"
这是……你与我定下的契约吗？,Is this... the contract you made with me?
是的，希望我们能够尽力帮助彼此。,"Yes, I hope we can try our best to help each other."
对了，我一直都没问，你们有什么需要我帮助的吗？,"By the way, I haven't asked, do you need any of my help?"
幻兽们被困在这个结界内已经很久了，一直找不到出去的方式。,"The Eudemons have been trapped in this enchantment for a long time, and they have not been able to find a way out."
我希望你能找到破除这个世界结界的办法，让我们获得自由。,I hope you can find a way to break the enchantment of this world and let us be free.
我明白了，那么你们在哪些事情上能帮助我呢？,"I see, so what can you do to help me?"
我们可以将力量传导给你们世界的神明，助她们一臂之力。,We can channel our powers to the gods of your world and help them.
此外，虽然结界限制了我们的行动，但对非生命体却毫无影响。,"In addition, although the enchantment restricts our actions, it has no effect on non-living bodies."
而这里有很多珍贵矿物可开采，每名幻兽都有独特的开采能力。,"And there are many precious minerals that can be mined, and each Eudemon has a unique mining ability."
天哪……我想我明白这意味着什么了……,OMG...I think I understand what this means…
对了，伊薇特！我想起来有个小礼物忘了送你。,"By the way, Yvette! I remembered that there was a small gift that I forgot to give you."
喔？是什么？幻兽们总会对礼物感到高兴的。,Oh? What is it? Eudemons are always happy with gifts.
是在森林里摘的果实，雪樱似乎很爱吃，我想你应该也会喜欢。,It is the fruit picked in the forest. Yukizakura seems to like it very much. I think you will like it too.
啊……这种果实名为灵气之果，确实是幻兽们非常钟爱的食物。,"Ah... this kind of fruit is called Reiki fruit, and it is indeed a favorite food for Eudemons."
我就不客气收下了，感谢你带来神明的恩惠。,"I will accept it, thank you for taking me the grace of the gods."
味道看来不错？我甚至都产生了你吃完后精神百倍的错觉。,Does it taste good? I even had the illusion that you were full of energy after eating.
其实你没说错，这种果实的确可以提升我们的力量！,"In fact, you are right, this kind of fruit can indeed enhance our strength!"
有一些果实甚至拥有非常强大的魔力，能让幻兽们长生不死。,"Some fruits even possess very powerful magical powers, which can make Eudemons immortal."
不会吧！真有这样的事？那我可得好好收集它们。,No way! Is there such a thing? Then I have to collect them well.
哎？！我是在做梦吗？！你是修好传送门的那个人类吧？,Hey? ! Am I dreaming? ! Are you the human who repaired the portal?
啊，原来是你，我正检查晶石之泉的状态，请不要打扰我。,"Ah, it turned out to be you, I was checking the status of Spar spring, please don't disturb me."
嗯？找我有事吗？如果有什么想聊的话，可以去我的房间。,"Um? how can I help you? If you want to talk, you can go to my room."
这片森林我曾经来过很多次，但还有很多地方没有探索过。,"I have been to this forest many times, but there are still many places that I haven't explored."
你是之前那个人类？！我是不死鸟妮菲塔莉，请多关照啦！,"Are you the human before? ! I’m the phoenix Nifitari, nice to meet you!"
你说想让我帮你去火山开采资源？嗯……让我再考虑一下吧。,You said you want me to help you go to the volcano to mine resources? Hmm... let me think about it.
是你啊，我也会偶尔出来走走，天天呆在火山口可太闷了。,"It's you, I also go out occasionally, it's too boring to stay in the crater every day."
我打算让火山喷发一次！这样可以带来更多有价值的资源！,I plan to let the volcano erupt once! This can bring more valuable resources!
和其他怕火的人类不同，你好像很喜欢来火山这边呢！,"Unlike other humans who are afraid of fire, you seem to like coming to the volcano!"
哟，没想到在这会遇到你，我是北海巨妖艾琳诺，请多指教了。,"Yo, I didn't expect to meet you here, I am Eleanore the Kraken, pleased to meet you."
我正在恢复神核祭坛的力量，完成后应该可以帮你不少忙。,"I'm restoring the power of Holy core altar, and should be able to help you a lot after completion."
我理解你急需我帮助，但我还没准备好，恐怕你得再等等。,"I understand that you need my help urgently, but I am not ready yet, I am afraid you will have to wait."
我偶尔会来山脚的瀑布处休息，毕竟我还是喜欢呆在水里。,"I occasionally come to rest at the waterfall at the foot of the mountain, after all, I still like to stay in the water."
啊！你吓到我了，请不要在做祷告的时候打扰我喔……,"Ah! You scared me, please don’t bother me when I am praying..."
你是来巡视的吗？祭坛一切正常，今天的收获也很丰富。,"Are you here for patrol? Everything is normal at the altar, and today's harvest is very rich."
啊！你是之前打扰我午睡的家伙！我芬妮尔今天非咬掉你的头！,"Ah! You are the one who interrupted my nap before! I, Fenrir, must bite off your head today!"
要我帮你开发钻石矿？那下次见面最好带几块美味的肉排给我。,Want me to help you to dig a diamond mine? Then you'd better bring me some delicious steaks when we meet next time.
其实我可不想天天睡觉，如果你雇佣我工作的话我或许会考虑。,"Actually, I don't want to sleep every day. If you hire me to work, I might consider it."
又是你啊，有美味的肉排吗？有的话我就去帮你打理矿坑喔！,"It's you again, do you have any delicious steaks? If so, I will help you take care of the mine!"
看看这块切割精美的钻石！这可是我的得意之作！,Look at this beautifully cut diamond! This is my masterpiece!
嗯……我好像发现了新的矿脉，等着我的好消息吧！,"Hmm... I seem to have discovered a new vein, waiting for my good news!"
ZZZ……啊！是你！别看着我发笑！我……我才没偷懒睡午觉呢！,ZZZ... Ah! It's you! Don't look at me adn laugh! I... I didn't slack off and take a nap!
之前都没来得及自我介绍，奴家名为雪樱，九尾的长女，幸会。,Oh... isn't this the human cutie? What a coincidence I met you.
嗯，感谢你对我的信任，但我还没想好是否要与你达成同盟。,"Well, thank you for your trust in me, but I haven't figured out whether to form an alliance with you."
是你啊，我刚寻找完炼金所需的材料，要一块散散步吗？,"It's you, I just finished searching for the materials needed for alchemy. Would you like to take a walk together?"
用炼金术合成宝石的技巧还是非常困难的，请再给我一点时间。,The technique of using alchemy to synthesize gems is still very difficult. Please give me some more time.
今天的炼金也很成功，希望宝石的产量也能让您满意。,"Today's alchemy is also very successful, and I hope that the output of gems will also satisfy you."
啊啦，您今天只是单纯来看望我的？这可真让我受宠若惊了……,"Ah, you just came to visit me today? This really flattered me…"
啊！是您啊，有兴趣今晚陪我去赏樱吗？今晚是个好时间呢！,"what! It's you, are you interested in accompany me to enjoy the sakura blossoms tonight? Tonight is a good time!"
你能穿越结界来到这里，必是神明的恩惠，愿我们的情谊永在。,"You can cross the enchantment to come here, it must be the grace of the gods, may our friendship be forever."
那座火山确实让我感觉不错，顺便帮你管理熔岩池也没问题啦！,"That volcano really makes me feel good, and it’s okay to help you manage Lava lake by the way!"
啊啦，看你如此诚心地请我帮你忙，我可就不好意思拒绝了呢……,"Ah, seeing you so sincerely asking me to help you, I am embarrassed to refuse…"
看在你给我提供美味肉排的份上，我就帮你运营钻石工坊吧！,"Seeing that you provide me with delicious steaks, I will help you run the Diamond Workshop!"
看来还是只有我这样出色的炼金术士，才配得上您的野心呢。,It seems that only an excellent alchemist like me is worthy of your ambition.

月宫玉兔,Jade Hare
嫦娥孤独的守在这月亮上，遥望着对面的繁华、喧闹的蓝色星球，很难不有万千思绪涌上心头。\n直到玉兔来到她的身边，带给嫦娥的不仅仅是陪伴，还有萦绕在这广寒宫的欢声笑语。,"Chang'e once lived alone on the moon, only able to admire our bustling blue planet from a lonely distance.\nShe remained alone with her thoughts until the Jade Hare joined her, providing companionship and helping to fill Guanghan Palace with the goddess's laughter."
限定专属：嫦娥,Exclusive Limited: Chang'e
嫦娥原本是个凡人，然而机缘巧合，她服食过西王母所赐予的仙药，具备了神格。\n随后她在月宫进行了长达几千年的修行，末日降临让她察觉到异样，并最终决定帮助同伴解决这次危机。,"Chang'e was born a mortal but later stole from Xiwangmu the Pill of Immortality, which transformed her into a goddess. \nShe then fled to the Guanghan Palace on the moon and spent millennia in solitude. And now that the world is ending, she has decided to help to resolve the crisis."
哼哼！你似乎也很喜欢兔子呢！至少喜欢小动物的家伙不会是坏人，看在这件事的份上，我就和你签下这份誓约吧！,"You like rabbits, too!? Then you must be a good person. That's reason enough for me to make this vow with you!"
你对小兔子感兴趣吗……？,Do you like bunnies?
你觉得这个世界变化大吗？没想到几千年来发生了这么多有趣的事！,Do you think the world has changed a lot? So much has happened in the last few thousand years.
你问我怎么看待战争？我是个和平主义者，不过你似乎是个……好战分子？,"You wanted to know what I thought of war? I am a pacifist, but you seem to be... a militant?"
即使在月宫修行的千年时间里，我有时也会怀念自己和同伴们过去的生活……,"After a thousand years at Guanghan Palace, I sometimes miss my past life and my former companions."
说起来，你知道我的身世吗？几千年的修行，让我早已忘了自己的过去。,"Do you know of my past? After thousands of years on the moon, I have forgotten almost everything."
月宫修行时每天只有成群的兔子相伴，一个说话的人也没有，很是无趣呢……,I spend my years alone in Guanghan Palace with the Jade Hare. I wish I had someone to talk to…
一般般吧。,Bunnies are alright…
变化的确不小。,The change is indeed not small.
呃……我不清楚。,Hmm... It doesn't seem like much has changed.
是的！你没猜错！,...You guessed correctly!
回忆是一种动力。,Memories can be very motivating.
我很少怀念过去。,I rarely miss the past.
我也不大知道……,I don’t know much…
我读过你的传说。,"Your story is a legend, and I know it well."
要我陪你聊聊么？,Do you want me to chat with you?
其实你很健谈……,Is that why you're so talkative?
那么你要不要养养看？！我在月宫养了几百只，正愁一个人照顾不过来呢！,"Do you want to help me raise them? I have kept hundreds of them in the Guanghan Palace, and I am worried that one person can't take care of all of them!"
不会吧！竟然会有人对毛茸茸的小可爱不动心？！这可真让我意外！,No way! I can't believe these furry little cuties don't excite you. I'm shocked!
看来从月宫回来的选择是正确的呢！我早就想大闹一番了！,I'm glad I chose to return from Guanghan Palace! I've been wanting to get involved in the action for a long time.
哎？！这样吗？不过也是，你好象只活了十多年而已……,"Eh? Is that so? ... But then again, you are still very young. You have not seen much of the world and its history."
哎？不是吗？不过虽然你作战勇猛，却能让我从心里面感受到一种温柔。,Huh? It isn't? Yet you fight so bravely... It causes my heart to stir.
我虽然不喜欢和人争斗，不过战争在我看来，至少比一个人在月宫修行要有意思。,"Although I don't like fighting with people, in my opinion, war is more interesting than practicing alone in the Guanghan Palace."
确实，每次我想到自己能够回到她们身边时，修行好像也变得不那么枯燥了……,"Indeed, every time I thought about returning, my practice routine felt more invigorating."
看来你对未来会发生什么更感兴趣，这点上倒是和我很像呢……,It seems that you are more interested in what will happen in the future. I'm the same way.
嗯，算了，我在这个世界的传说现在才要真正开始呢！,Forget about it. I am about to create a new legend as we fight to save the world!
哎？！原来几千年后，人们已经把我当成这么传奇的存在了吗？！,Eh? People recorded my story in legend and still remember it after thousands of years?
哎？！可以吗？！如果你方便的话今晚能来我的房间么？！我有很多话想和你说……,"May I? If it's convenient for you, would you come to my room tonight? I have so much I want to tell you..."
那个……其实我不是对谁都这么多话……因为没有多少人愿意听我长篇大论……,"Yes, I can be a bit long-winded, and that can be a bit off-putting. Therefore I'm trying to learn to hold my tongue and listen."
月饼,moon cake
中秋节活动专属兑换道具，可通过活动和日常挂机获取,"Exclusive redemption items for Full-Moon events, which can be obtained through events and daily idling"
东方的神明似乎很喜欢独自一人过日子，是这样么？,"The goddes of the East seem to like to live alone, right?"
哎？！有这种事吗？！我怎么不觉得？,Eh? ! Is there such a thing? ! Why don't I think so?
至少在月宫里过了几千年的你，让我们产生了这种错觉。,"At least you, who have been in the Guanghan Palace for several thousand years, gave us this illusion."
其实只是东方的神明在修行时……不大喜欢被打扰而已了。,"In fact, it’s just that the Eastern goddes don’t like being disturbed when they are practicing."
喔？是吗？那么就让我们来看看你修行的成果吧！,Oh? Yeah? Then let us take a look at the results of your practice!
你的兔子比你本人打起架来还凶……这可真让我意外……,Your rabbit is more fierce than you in a fight... This really surprised me...
先在对手身上积蓄魔力，再让月兔引爆，不错的战术呢。,"It is a good tactic to accumulate magic power on the opponent first, and then let the Jade hare detonate."
嗯……相对于持久对抗，我更喜欢配合月兔一波击溃对手。,Hmm...I prefer to cooperate with Jade hare to defeat opponents rather than protracted confrontation.
有月兔这么强大的“同伴”，你甚至可以和女娲较量较量。,"With such a powerful companion like Jade hare, you can even compete with Nuwa."
不错的提醒！这么久没回昆仑山，我也该去打个招呼了。,"Nice reminder! I haven't returned to Kunlun Mountain for so long, and I should also go and say hello."
嫦娥？是你？！自从你离开昆仑山后，已经几千年没见了！,"Chang'e? It's you? ! Since you left Kunlun Mountain, we haven't seen each other for thousands of years!"
难道是在月宫太无聊，想回来帮助我们结束这场末日了？,"Is it too boring in the Guanghan palace, so you want to come back to help us end this doomsday?"
我确实有这个想法，但不清楚自己究竟做不做得到……,"I do have this idea, but I don’t know if I can do it…"
凡事无定数，修行千年之后，你的能力或许早已超乎想象。,"Everything is uncertain, after a thousand years of practice, your abilities may have been beyond imagination."
我想，一场试炼应该能成为最好的证明。,I think a trial should be the best proof.
啊！停手停手！认输了！这强大的爆发力让人难以招架……,Ah! Stop it! I give up! This powerful explosive force makes me hard to resist...
唔……先积蓄后爆发，看来阴阳相合的力量确实了得……,Hmm…Accumulate first and then explode. It seems that the power of Yin and Yang is really powerful...
你的修行让人刮目相看，希望这份力量能为世界带来安宁。,"Your practice is impressive, and I hope this power can bring peace to the world."
我会尽力的，能够回到昆仑山来，其实我已经很开心了。,I will try my best. I am actually very happy to be able to come back to Kunlun Mountain.
毕竟在月宫几千年，只能与月兔相伴，实在闷得慌。,"After all, for thusands of years, my only accompanion in the Guanghan Palace is Jade hare, which is really frustrating."
芙蕾雅，你看上去心神不宁，与希腊的战事又遇到麻烦了？,"Freyja, you look restless, and you are in trouble again in the war with Greece?"
恰恰相反，希腊众神在战场上遇到我后，一直有意回避。,"On the contrary, the Greek gods have been deliberately avoiding me after they met me on the battlefield."
赫拉甚至私下邀请我加入希腊神系，这倒让我挺感兴趣……,"Hera even privately invited me to join the Greek gods, which interested me…"
有意思了呢！我大概明白怎么回事了，老大，您怎么看？,"Interesting! I probably understand what's going on, boss, what do you think?"
如果过得了我们这关，我不介意芙蕾雅你去希腊见见世面。,"If you can pass me, I don't mind you, Freyja, to go to Greece to meet the world."
快停手！之前只是开玩笑而已！我可没打算背叛同伴！,Stop it! It was just a joke before! I didn't intend to betray my companions!
别紧张，亲爱的，北欧的各位从不质疑你的忠诚。,"Don't be nervous, dear, everyone from Northern Europe never questions your loyalty."
这杀伤力对于护甲被破坏的对手……真是如同噩梦一般……,This lethality is like a nightmare for opponents whose armor is broken...
你很懂得趁胜追击的道理，敌人越少你的能力越占优势……,"You know how to take advantage of the victory, the less the enemy, the more you have the advantage…"
去见见赫拉吧，我挺期待她见到你完全觉醒后的表情。,"Go and see Hera, I'm looking forward to her expression when she sees you fully awakened."
北欧的芙蕾雅吗……我们知道你会来，但没想到这么快……,"Freyja from Northern Europe... We knew you would come, but we didn't expect to be so soon..."
希腊的主神，赫拉阁下曾邀请过我，我可没打算失约。,"Your Excellency Hera, main god of Greece once invited me. I did not intend to miss the appointment."
等你很久了，我一直想试试以一敌百的英雄究竟有多强。,"I have been waiting for you for a long time, and I have always wanted to find out how strong a heroine with overwhileming power is."
如我胜了，我希望暂停彼此因争夺人类信仰而产生的冲突。,"If I win, I hope to suspend the conflict between each other due to the struggle for human faith."
没问题，但如果你输了，就必须成为我赫拉最忠诚的护卫！,"No problem, but if you lose, you must be my most loyal guard!"
唔……我们大意了吗……真是令人遗憾的结果……,Hmm…We've been careless... It's a regrettable result...
胜负已分，赫拉阁下，希望您能守约，我会铭记此约定。,"The outcome is obvious, your excellency Hera, I hope you can fulfill the promise, and I will keep this promise in mind."
北欧有芙蕾雅这把利剑和海姆达尔这面盾牌，毫无破绽。,"Northern Europe has the sword of Freyja and the shield of Heimdall, and there is no flaw."
至少我很清楚，这个战争与爱情的化身和我不是一类人……,At least I know very well that this incarnation of war and love is not the same kind of person as me...
呵……战争与爱情吗……终究是我可望而不可及的事物呢……,"Heh... War and love... After all, it is something I can't reach…"

幻兽已满级，自动转化为晶石,"Eudemon is at full level, automatically converted into {0} spar"
是你啊！有兴趣帮我找一只从月亮上来的兔子么？把她抓来给我，我就帮你去开采新的钻石矿。,"Oh, it's you! Are you interested in helping me finding a rabbit from the moon? Catch her to me, and I will help you mine new diamond mine."
好吧，我猜熙玉那只兔子又找你告我的状了。别总怀疑我！我可没兴趣拿她当晚餐！,"Alright, I guess that rabbit Xiyu has spoken ill of me agian. Don't doubt me! I'm not interested in eating her for dinner!"
咦？你是人类吗？！除了嫦娥姐姐外我还是第一次遇到别的人类呢！,"Huh? Are you human? ! Except Sister Chang'e, this is the first time I have encountered other human beings!"
难道是这条路吗……啊！是你啊，我好像迷路了，能带我回幻兽之森吗？,"Could it be this way...Ah! It's you, I seem to be lost, can you take me back to the Forest of Eudemons?"
呃……抱歉，我只是想试试是否能通过传送门回到月宫，没想到连接到了这里……,"Uh...Sorry, I just want to try if I can go back to the Guanghan Palace through the portal, but I didn't expect to be connected here..."
能让我躲一下吗？有只自称芬妮尔的狼，一直在矿山那边找我，我感觉不大妙……,"Can you hide me for a while? There is a wolf who calls herself Fenrir, who has been looking for me over the gem mine. I don’t feel good..."
主人，那个……您最近喂过芬妮尔吗？我总感觉她在用一种观赏美食的眼神盯着我……,"Master, well... have you fed Fenrir recently? I always feel that she is staring at me with a look of staring at food..."
主人，和我去矿山看看如何？我和芬妮尔又发现一大片新矿脉呢！,"Master, how about going to the mine with me? Fenrir and I have discovered a large new vein!"
哼哼！主人您来得正好，要见识一下雪樱姐姐新教我的宝石炼金技巧吗？,"Humph! Master, you came right in time. Would you like to see the gem cutting skills that Sister Yukizakura taught me?"
熙玉原本是月宫所有的兔子总管，嫦娥对她青睐有加，所以赋予了她过人的智慧和精巧的手艺。嫦娥很喜欢美丽而价值连城的宝石，所以她也就理所当然地成为了月宫里技巧最高的宝石匠。嫦娥离开月宫后，熙玉曾经想通过传送门寻找，但不知为何传送门连接到了幻兽之森……,"Xiyu was originally the head of all the rabbits in the Guanghan Palace, and Chang'e liked her very much, so she gave her extraordinary wisdom and exquisite craftsmanship.Chang'e likes beautiful and priceless gems, so Xiyu naturally became the most skilled jeweler in the Guanghan Palace.After Chang'e left the Guanghan palace, Xiyu once wanted to find her through the portal, but somehow the portal was connected to the Forest of Eudemons..."
那个……看在你对我这么关心的份上，在回到嫦娥姐姐身边之前，我就接受你做我的主人吧。,"Well... For the sake of your caring of me, before returning to Sister Chang'e, I will accept you as my master."

命不由天-阿修罗,Master of Their Own Destiny-Asura
命不由天,Master of Their Own Destiny
阿修罗碎片,Asura Shard
集齐55个阿修罗碎片可以召唤阿修罗,Collect 55 Asura Shards to summon Asura
阿修罗易怒好斗、骁勇善战，在修罗场中不断战斗，不断磨练着战斗意志。\n在传闻中，阿修罗凶神恶煞，让敌人胆寒；但在另一种传闻中，阿修罗端正美貌；即使是敌人也为之倾倒。,"Asura is a strong fighter, known for being irritable, combative, and brave. She constantly hones her fighting skill by battling with Shuraba.\nAccording to rumors, Asura is fierce and terrible, always filling her enemies with fear. But others say Asura is so gorgeous that even her enemies fall for her beauty."
敢找我搭话，你难道不畏惧我吗？,"Dare to talk to me, don't you fear me?"
战斗中的修罗场对于我不过小场面，感情中的修罗场才是真正的磨炼！,The Shuraba of battles is nothing but a small scene for me; the Shuraba of love is the real tempering!
我可是会千变万化的，啥时候惹我不高兴了，就变化一个吓吓你！,"I'm a shape-shifter. Whenever you upset me,  I will change and scare you!"
我这恐怖的外表下，潜藏着特别的灵魂。,"Under my terrifying appearance,  there is a special soul hidden."
你应该也爱美食的，啥时候尝尝我做的，这方面我可是拿手的。,You should have loved food. Taste the food I cooked sometimes; I am good at cooking.
有时心中也会感慨万千，从前无人倾诉，还好遇见了你。,"Sometimes I feel a lot of emotions in my heart,  no one talked to me before,  but fortunately I met you."
多少还是有点。,It's still a little bit.
莫非你遇到过？,Did you meet it?
别别别！,Don't don't!
恐怖的灵魂？,Horrible soul?
害怕起来了。,Getting scared.
我也感到幸运。,I also feel lucky.
哈哈，并不。,"Haha,  no."
你也有害怕的事呢。,You are also afraid of things.
哼，我才不怕呢。,"Humph,  I'm not afraid."
你外表可迷人了。,You look charming.
迫不及待了。,Can't wait anymore.
相见恨晚的感觉。,The feeling of seeing each other late.
勇气可嘉，还好我今日心情不错，以后可不要随随便便去和危险的人去搭话。,"Very courageous. Fortunately,  I am in a good mood today,  so don't just go and talk to dangerous people in the future."
我倒没有，但是我却窥探过很多凡人们的曲折感情经历，从而有感而发。,"I don’t have one, but I have spied on many mortal people’s tortuous and emotional experiences,  so I feel inspired."
知道怕啦？知道怕就好，可得想着法让我开心了。,"Scared? Good,  then you will have to find ways to make me happy."
你咋这么会开玩笑呢，小心我这恐怖的灵魂这就把你吃了。,"Why are you so good at joking,  be careful that my terrifying soul will eat you up."
害怕啥，人不能貌相，你被刻板印象束缚了，来尝一下改变你的想法。,"Why so scared,  you can't judge a person by her appearance. You are bound by stereotypes,  let's try to change your mind."
果然真正的感情都是双向奔赴的，以后你有啥苦恼也要告诉我呀，可不能瞒着。,"The true relationship is mutual,  so you have to tell me if you have any troubles in the future,  don't hide it."
看来自身有力量说话就是硬气，我这么强大的气场都劝退不了你。,"Seems like a powerful person like you can speak powerful words,  even I who have strong aura can't persuade you."
哈哈，我的软肋可不能乱和别人说哦，只能作为我们两人的秘密。,"Haha,  you can’t talk to others about my weakness,  it's a secret for the two of us."
嘿，还傲娇起来了，可别到时候把你吓哭了，我可不忍心你哭呢。,"Sooooo pretentious! Don't be scared to cry then,  I can't bear you crying."
哇！你平时也这样吗？这么会说话，以后我可得用新的姿态跟你说话了。,"Wow! Do you usually do the same? If you are so good at witty words,  I will have to talk to you in the future with a new way."
看在你如此信任我的份上，就看我为你收集天地之精华，为你烹饪一顿绝世佳肴。,"For the sake of you trusting me so much, I'm gonna collecting the essence of heaven and earth and cooking a peculiar meal for you."
在宇宙中、在神明的观念里，这段等待的时间不过沧海之一粟，遇见了终归是值得！,"In the universe, in the concept of the gods,  this waiting time is nothing but a drop in the ocean,  and it is worth it if eventually meet!"
孤芳自赏,Self-admiration
永恒黑洞,Eternal Blackhole
同甘共苦,Share weal and woe
阿修罗UR碎片,UR Asura Shards
和我达成誓约，梦中都难以想象的场景竟然实现了！今后的日子我将更加细致照顾你，守护你的未来，还能给你做好吃的哦。,"I never imagined that my dream would come true. Of course, I will make a vow with you! From now on, I promise to protect you... and cook you amazingly delicious food."

在这条孤独的道路上，总归需要有个指引，不论它是否是心中所想的那道光。\n阿修罗对待的敌人的灵魂貌似也没那么残忍，对于修罗场上遍体鳞伤的肉体也算是一点藉慰。,"On this lonely road, there is always a need for guidance, no matter whether it is the light in her heart. \nAsura didn't seem to treated the enemies' souls so cruel, and it was a bit of comfort for the bruised fleshes in Shuraba."

这强大的气场是怎么回事，月兔竟然被吓成这样……,"What is going on with this powerful aura, Moon Rabbit was so scared ..."
东方的修行者吗……你们不是我要较量的人，让我过去。,"Eastern practitioners... You are not the one that I want to beat, let me pass here."
你是谁？月宫可不是外人能够随意出入的地方！,Who are you? The Moon Palace is not a place where outsiders can enterl!
我乃六道战争之神，炼狱之主阿修罗……,I'm the god of six wars - asura the lord of purgatory...
你散发的黑暗斗气危险无比，恐怕我不能让你继续前进了！,"The dark vindictiveness you exude is extremely dangerous, I'm afraid that I can't stop you!"
恐怖的气场……即使是再强的人也难免心生畏惧……,Terrifying aura...Even the strongest people are inevitably afraid of...
她的战意如同一道结界，仿佛紧紧地锁住了我们的力量……,"Her intent to fight is like a barrier, as if it tightly locks our strength..."
难以置信，她的同伴却能利用这种结界变得强大……,"Unbelievably, her companion can use this kind of enchantment to become powerful..."
看来人界的最强者并不在此，真是令人遗憾。,"It seems that the strongest in the human world is not here, which is really regrettable."
她的力量太危险了！我们最好通知六大神系的其他神明！,Her power is too dangerous! We better inform the other gods of the six gods!
来了吗？她就是沈青儿、嫦娥还有卑弥呼所说的那个家伙？,"OMG! Is she the guy that Sim Cheong, Chang'e and Himiko said?"
你散发的斗气让人感到不安，可以告诉我你来此的原因吗？,The vindictiveness you exude makes people feel uneasy. Can you tell me why you are here?
我为纷争与审判而生，挑战人界最强者是我的唯一目的……,I was born for disputes and judgments. My purpose is challenging the strongest in the human world...
你们的战意让我兴奋，我会好好体会这场较量的快感……,"Your fighting spirit excites me, and I will enjoy the pleasure of this contest..."
真是个爱挑衅的家伙，作为战争之神，我可不会手下留情！,"What a provocative guy, as the god of war, I will not show mercy!"
呵……看来，和你战斗确实是一件让人上瘾的事情。,Heh... It seems that fighting with you is indeed an addictive thing.
是我大意了，你主宰战斗意志的能力，的确非同小可……,"I'm taking care of it, your ability to dominate the will to fight is indeed not trivial..."
真是令人满足的战斗，可惜你们也并非我理想中的最强者。,"What a satisfying battle, but unfortunately you are not the strongest in my ideals."
有个人我想你会感兴趣的，她算是众神明的指挥官和统领。,There is someone I think you will be interested in. She is the commander and leader of the gods.
传闻中的那个人类女孩么？我应该会很享受和她的战斗……,Is that the human girl in the rumor? I should enjoy fighting with her...

增加悠妮丝50点好感度,Increase Eunice's favorability by 50 points
没人知道悠妮丝究竟在混沌外域的迷宫里呆了多久，但从她对迷宫了如指掌的熟悉程度来看，时间恐怕不会短。只有米诺陶洛斯一族才能在深邃的迷宫里搜寻宝藏而不迷路，探险本领上悠妮丝更是同族中的精英。她天赋禀异，是唯一能凭借良好的方向感和敏锐的洞察力，找到隐藏在迷宫深处钻石矿脉的幻兽。,"No one knows how long Eunice has stayed in the maze of Chaotic Realm, but judging from her familiarity with the maze, the time may not be short.Only the Minotaurs clan can search for treasures in the deep maze without getting lost, and Eunice is the elite of the clan in terms of exploration skills.She is talented, and she is the only Eudemon that can find diamond veins hidden in the depths of the maze with her good sense of direction and keen insight."
在过去一段时间里，悠妮丝受了不少照顾呢……那个……如果可以的话……您愿意和我订下契约吗……？,"In the past period of time, Eunice have received a lot of care... Well... If could... Would you like to seal the pact with me...?"
哎？这道传送门是你开的吗？呼……太好了，悠妮丝正愁在迷宫里找不到出去的路呢……,"Hey? Did you open this portal? Phew... Great, Eunice is worried that she can't find a way out in the maze..."
是你啊，那个……悠妮丝正准备把钻石原矿送到工坊去，如果方便的话，能帮我一块搬吗……？,"It's you, well... Eunice is about to send the diamond ore to the workshop. If it is convenient, can you help me move it...?"
嗯？你是上次见到的那个人类啊……看来世界比悠妮丝想象得要小呢……,Um? You are the human you saw last time... It seems that the world is smaller than Eunice imagined...
唔，有话请一会儿再说，悠妮丝刚刚发现一大片新的钻石矿脉呢……,"Um, please say something later, Eunice has just discovered a large new diamond vein..."
那个……您最好去工坊看看，我听说狼人芬妮尔饿得够呛，正抓熙玉那只兔子当午餐呐……,Um... you'd better go to the workshop. I heard that the werewolf Fenrir was so starving that she's gonna catching Xiyu the rabbit for lunch…
呜……搬运矿石的推车好像坏了，如果您不赶时间的话，能帮悠妮丝修一下吗？,"Woo... the cart that carries the diamonds seems to be broken, if you are not in a hurry, could you possibbly fix it for Eunice?"
哎？您是专门来找悠妮丝的吗？别担心……就算迷宫再复杂，我也能分清方向呢……,"Hey? Are you here specifically for Eunice? Don't worry... No matter how complicated the maze is, I can tell the direction..."
你问我和那个叫悠妮丝的家伙关系如何？她火辣的身材很合我口味喔！不过看见我就会脸红着跑开让我很不爽！,"You ask me how I am related to that one named Eunice? Her hot figure suits my taste!But she blushes and runs away when she sees me, which makes me very upset!"
听说来了一位名叫悠妮丝的米诺陶洛斯族幻兽呢！这下可不用怕芬妮尔欺负我了！,I heard that a Minotaurs Eudemon named Eunice came! I no longer need to worry about Fenrir bullying me now!

缘结神？我错觉了吗？你的神格强大了好几倍？！,Enmusubi? Is it my illusion? Your godhead is much more powerful than before? !
的确如此，倒不如说我正是为此来找你们询问原因的。,"Indeed, it is better to say that I am here to ask you why."
与其说是强大的神格……不如说是强大的信仰之力……,It's not so much a powerful godhead... it's the power of faith...
难道是人们对缘分的信念凝聚在一起后，所诞生的力量？,"So, this is the power that is born from people's believes in destiny?"
光猜是没有结论的，或许一场战斗能够解释很多问题。,There is no conclusion by just guessing. Perhaps a battle can explain many problems.
看来这力量能给与同伴强大的鼓舞，并让对手心境混乱。,It seems that this power can give a strong encouragement to the friendly and mess up hostile's minds.
你的新神格并非来源于大众的信仰……而是某个独特的人。,Your new godhead is not derived from popular belief...but a unique person.
某个独特的人？您的意思是……,Someone unique? what do you mean……
身为掌控羁绊的神明，竟也会诞生属于自己的羁绊？,"As the god who controls fate, she has had her own fate?"
我想，同为掌控因缘的赫拉或许能给你一个完美的解释……,"I think Hera, who is also in control of fate, may be able to give you a perfect explanation……"
于是……大和的羁绊之神怎么有兴趣来希腊闲逛了？,So... why is the god of fate of Yamato interested in visiting Greece?
我应天照大神引导，来找赫拉阁下寻求一个问题的解释。,"Under the guidance of Amaterasu, I came to Hera for an explanation of a problem."
不行，没有事先准备的聚会可没法让赫拉大人开心得起来。,"No, a party without proper preparation would not amuse Lord Hera"
别那么认真，伊卡璐斯，我知道她来这里的原因。,"Don't be so serious, Icarus, I know why she is here."
但在告诉她答案前，我想先看看她觉醒的力量有多强大。,"But before revealing the answer, I want to see how powerful her awakening power is."
你的能力似乎现在变得更加强大了……真是难以理解……,So confused...Your abilities seem to be stronger now…
天照大神说我的能力觉醒于某种强烈的思念，真的如此吗？,"Amaterasu said that my ability was awakened by some kind of strong longing, is it so?"
哼，真是让我嫉妒的说法，直白讲，就是某人喜欢上你了。,"Humph, it’s a statement that makes me jealous. To put it bluntly, someone fall in love with you."
哎？！我从来没有想过有人会对我……,Ah? ! I never thought that someone would...
去寻找那个对你动心的家伙吧，他现在正满脑子想着你呐。,"Go find the guy who is tempted by you, his head is full of you now."

黄道十二星座之一幻化而来的特殊神明，原本不具备神力，但众神无休止的战争让其神格化。\n由象征秩序的“白”与象征混乱的“黑”组成，同时拥有正反两种力量的她们非常强大，但性格也非常极端、多变。,"Gemini is a special goddess transformed from one of the zodiac constellations. Originally lacking divine power, she was granted deification for her valor in endless wars. Both black and white sides of Gemini possess powerful and contrasting skills. The white embodies order, while the black unleashes chaos. Both personalities are extreme and changeable."
相比于看着残酷的现实，我更愿意与镜中的自己度过每日的时光……,"Rather than looking at the cruel reality, I am more willing to spend my daily time with myself in the mirror…"
每个人的心中，都有另一个截然相反的自己，你能感觉到吗？,There is another diametrically opposite self in everyone's heart. Can you feel it?
你在我的这面镜子中，看到了什么？,What do you see in my mirror?
你喜欢穿黑色衣服的我，还是白色的？,"Do you like me in black, or white?"
我时常也会苦恼，我和镜子里的自己，到底哪一个才是真实的我？,I am also distressed from time to time. If the me in the mirror is the real me?
现实并非如此。,The reality is not so.
没什么感觉……,Nothing feels…
另一个你？,Another you?
我喜欢黑色。,I like black.
或许两个都是？,Perhaps both are?
至少你并不孤单,At least you're not lonely
嗯！我也有同感！,Yeh!I feel the same!
似乎空空如也？,Seems empty?
我喜欢白色。,I like white.
感觉没什么意义……,Feels like meaningless...
你说的也对……我们和你在一起的这段时间，确实体验到了不曾有过的温暖……,"What you said is right... During the time we were together with you, we did experience a warmth we never had before…"
这样吗？或许只是你内心的另一个自己还未觉醒而已吧？,Is that so? Maybe another self in your heart hasn't been awakened yet?
很少人能看见我镜中的另一个身影……看来这也是你我命运交织的证明……,Few people can see another figure in my mirror... It seems to be the proof of the intertwined fate of you and me...
啊啦……黑色代表着神秘与性感，原来你喜欢成熟而有魅力的女孩子呢……,"Ara...Black represents mystery and sexy, so you like mature and attractive girls..."
我也这么想，但有时候我们心意相通，有时候却同床异梦呢……,"I think so, but sometimes we share the same feelings, and sometimes we have different thoughts..."
嘻嘻……你的意思是自己一个人感到寂寞了？那么……今晚要我们陪你吗？,Heehee...You mean you feel lonely alone? So... do you want us to accompany you tonight?
她是什么样的人呢？会是你的知己吗？还是说……会是你的敌人呢？,What kind of person is she? Will she be your confidant? Or... will she be your enemy?
喔？是吗？相对于你的谎言，你的表情可是很诚实呢……嘻嘻……,"Oh? Yeah? Compared to your lies, your expression is very honest... hee hee…"
嗯……白色代表着纯洁和温柔，看来你喜欢清纯可爱的女孩子呀！,Hmm...White represents purity and tenderness. It seems that you like pure and cute girls!
或许确实没什么意义，毕竟我们都是真实存在的，何必分出彼此呢？,"Maybe it really doesn't make much sense. After all, we are all real, so why separate each other?"

话说，自从流落到东方大陆后，我们一直记不起过去的事。,"Well well, ever since we were exiled to the Eastern Continent, we have never remembered the past."
啊啦？东方众神最宠爱的两个孩子，也到叛逆期了吗？,Ara? Are the two children most beloved by the Eastern goddesses also in the rebellious period?
我们只是很想知道，自己究竟是何处的神明而已……,We just want to know where exactly we were from...
我记得天照大神你……似乎知道她们的来历？,"I remember Amaterasu, you... seem to know their origins?"
是的，但我希望看看，你们是否已经拥有面对回忆的资格。,"Yes, but I want to see if you already have the qualifications to face the memories."
真令我意外，我以为你们会像以前那样毫无配合胡乱进攻。,"It really surprised me, I thought you would attack indiscriminately and uncooperatively as before."
没想到如今，你们的默契程度已经令人刮目相看了。,"Unexpectedly, now, the degree of your tacit understanding has been impressive."
我们自己也很吃惊，仿佛两个灵魂合二为一了似的。,"We were also surprised, as if the two souls were merged into one."
能够兼顾攻守，将彼此的优势与战术结合，很了不起呢！,"Being able to take into account both offense and defense, combining each other's strengths with tactics, impressive!"
看来你们到触碰自己记忆的时刻了，去北欧问问芙蕾雅吧。,It seems that it’s time for you to touch your own memories. Go to Northern Europe and ask Freyja.
我预见了你们的到来，但我并不能让你们通过。,"I foresee your arrival, but I cannot let you pass."
我们只是来寻找自己过去的记忆而已，您对此有所知晓吗？,We are just here to find our own past memories. Do you know anything about it?
没有感情的冰霜女王，是你们要寻找的命运之源……,"The Frost Queen, who has no emotions, is the source of fate that you are looking for..."
她是封印你们记忆，以及将你们放逐到东方之人。,She is the one who sealed your memory and banished you to the east.
冰霜龙母？好吧，不管如何我们必须见到她，请让开吧！,"Frost Dragon? Well, we must see her no matter what, please step aside!"
哼哼……两个有趣的少女呢……,Humph... two interesting girls...
没想到曾经的仇人，现在成了默契无比的同伴……,"Unexpectedly, the former enemies have now become tacit companions..."
您并没有拿出全部的力量阻止我们……,You did not use all your strength to stop us...
我即使全力应战，或许也无法胜过现在你们之间的羁绊。,"Even if I fight with all my strength, I may not be able to overcome the fetters between you now."
去见你们的创造者吧，她会告诉你们过去的一切……,"Go meet your creator, she will tell you everything..."
你们是……当年北欧的永恒之冰所幻化的那面双子之镜？,Are you... the twins who transformed from the eternal ice of Northern Europe?
我们并不知道自己是谁，倒不如说我们正是为此而来。,"We don't know who we are, it's better to say that's what we are here for."
你们的存在会给世界带来灾难……我不能让你们再次离开……,Your existence will bring disaster to the world...I can't let you leave again...
但如今你们的命运似乎产生了变化，如果你们胜得过我……,"But now your destiny seems to have changed, if you beat me..."
我就告诉你们一切的真相，和你们的过往吧……,"I will tell you all the truth, and your past..."
告诉我们吧，我们究竟有着怎样的过去……,"Tell us, what kind of past we have..."
镜中双子，爱上了同一个照镜者，嫉妒让二人反目成仇。,"The twins in the mirror fell in love with the same person who looked into the mirror, and their jealousy turned them into enemies."
诅咒在镜中凝聚，记忆在她们的脑海中消散无踪……,"The curse is condensed in the mirror, and the memory disappears in their minds..."
而如今，镜外之人早已不在，姐妹们找回了曾经的羁绊……,"Now, the person outside the mirror is no longer there, and the sisters have recovered the fetters they once had..."
命运向来晦涩，自己理解吧，总有一天你们会明白的。,"Fate has always been obscure, think about it by yourself, you will understand it one day."

啊啦……每每想到签定誓约时，另一个我都能听到只会对你说的……那些脸红心跳的话……真是令人感到害羞呢……,"Whenever I've thought of making a vow to you, the other me could sense those private thoughts. I blush when I think she knows how I feel about you."

你怎么看待战争的意义？,What do you think of the meaning of the war?
希腊的主神，宙斯与赫拉二人，你更欣赏哪一位呢？,"Zeus and Hera, two Greek gods, which one do you prefer?"
面对即将到来的战斗，你认为军队的实力和精妙的策略哪个更重要？,"Facing the coming war, which do you think is more important, the strength of the army or the ingenious strategy?"
你觉得这场神明之间的战争浩劫，会是某个幕后黑手所为吗？,Do you think that some evil force is behind the catastrophe?
我并非命运女神，但依旧有很多人类渴望来我这里倾听自己的未来。,"I’m not the goddess of fate, but countless people still come here and eager to predict their futures."
如果为了追寻一段完美的爱情，你愿意付出失去智慧的代价吗？,"If you have chance to pursuit a perfect love, are you willing to pay the price of losing your wisdom?"
战争带来毁灭……,War brings destruction...
嗯……赫拉大人吧。,Hmm...Lord Hera
军队的实力。,The strength of the army.
我确实这么认为。,I really think so.
其实我也想听听。,I also want to do the same.
我想我会愿意的。,I presume I will do it.
战争带来荣耀！,War brings glory.
应该是宙斯大人。,Ought to be Lord Zeus.
精妙的策略。,Ingenious strategy.
或许你多心了吧？,Maybe you just overthink.
眼界决定命运。,Vision determines destiny
这或许不大值得。,It may not be worth it.
是的，不管你是否相信，虽然我司掌战争，但却是最期待和平降临的神明。,"Yes. Believe it or not, I’m in charge of war, but I’m the one who expect peace the most."
如果她能够收敛几分嫉妒，增添几分谦逊与智慧的话，或许会更有魅力。,She might be more attractive if she could temper her jealousy and be a little more humble and intelligent.
嗯，看来你也认为利用强大的战斗力正面进攻，反而是最合适的策略……,"Well, you agree that the most appropriate strategy is to attack directly with the powerful force..."
如果确实如此，那这场世界末日恐怕会比我们想象中麻烦很多。,"If so, there must be much more troubles than we thought."
喔，是吗？但我并不能告诉你有关你的将来，不然命运女神该找我麻烦了。,"Oh, yeah? But I cannot tell you anything about your future or else I’ll get in trouble."
是么……？那么，你认为什么样的女性……才算完美呢？,"Right...? Well, which kind of female... do you think is perfect?"
确实如此，但这种荣耀却建立在杀戮与死亡之上，有些让我难以接受……,"Indeed, but this glory is just founded on the base of killing and death, which is unacceptable for me..."
呵呵……从某些兴趣与爱好上来说，你和宙斯大人的确有很多相似之处呢……,"Haha...You do have a lot in common with Lord Zeus, in terms of certain interests and preferences"
看来和我所想的一样，你也是一位擅长以头脑制胜的指挥者。,"It seems like you are, as I thought, a mastermind."
我会继续调查这件事的真相，毕竟还有太多让人想不通的疑点和巧合。,"I'll continue to investigate the truth, after all, there are remaining lots of puzzles and coincidences."
而智慧决定眼界，不是吗？有我在你身边的话，你一定能够掌控自己的命运。,"And wisdom determines vision, doesn't it? With me by your side, you can control your own destiny."
我挺欣慰的，看来至少在你的心目中，智慧依旧是最宝贵的东西……,"I'm glad to know that, in your mind at least, wisdom is still the most precious thing"
这份誓约象征着你我意志的结合，愿我的智慧能够带给你面对敌人的勇气，愿我的力量能够引导你通向胜利的路途。,Our vow unites us. Allow my wisdom and strength to help you find the courage to face your enemies and defeat them in battle.
希腊掌控战争、智慧与艺术的著名女神，宙斯和第一代智慧女神墨提斯的女儿。\n她是兼勇敢、美貌、智慧于一身的神明，神能极为强大，是战术与战略上的大师。哪怕在绝境中，她也能找到一丝通向胜利的曙光。,"Athena is the goddess of war, wisdom, and art in Greek mythology. She is the daughter of Zeus and Metis, the first angel of wisdom.\nShe is the angel of bravery, beauty and wisdom with great divine power. Meanwhile, she is the master of tactics and strategy. Even trapped in an impasse, she could find the ray of light leading to victory."

这里并非奥林匹斯山，难道我传送的地点产生了偏差……,This isn’t Olympus. It seems like I have been sent to a wrong place...
嗯？据我们所观察……你好像是希腊的……智慧女神？,Um? From what we’ve seen...you must be...the angel of wisdom in Greece.
我感到你们的神格非常强大，但你们不是正统的神明吧？,"I can feel that your godhead is very powerful, but you’re not the orthodox gods."
是不是正统神明不重要，但我们是这片神域边境的守卫。,"It’s not important whether we are orthodox or not, but we are the border guards of this sanctuary."
而作为守护者，恐怕我们得把你“安全”地送出边境……,"So as the guards, it's our duty to see you off safely from here..."
看来你们的手段不够“安全”，不是么？,"But actually, your methods are not safe enough, are you?"
你在战场上的战斗力和战术安排，确实令人惊叹。,"Indeed, your combat power and tactics on the battle is extremely impressive."
击溃对手的团队核心总是最有效的，身为指挥者我很清楚。,"It's always best to break the core of your opponent's team, and I know that clearly as a commander."
对了，你似乎在找希腊的同伴？作为刚才失礼的歉意……,"By the way, I guess that you’re looking for the Greek companions. I would like to apologize for my impoliteness..."
我们就帮你个忙好了，例如开个传送门之类的怎么样？,Just let us do you a favor. Do you think opening a portal could help you?
雅典娜……？！天哪，宙斯在上，我是不是在做梦？！,"Athena...?! Gosh, Lord Zeus, am I just dreaming?!"
真令我失望，你这个讨厌的家伙竟然没被永远困在神界。,I’m so disappointed that you’re not stuck in the divine realm forever.
时间真是太残酷了，看来我的智慧已经不再被众神所青睐。,"Time is cruel. Obviously, my wisdom has fallen out of the favor with the gods."
别这么说，或许战场的较量能让我们重新认识你，亲爱的。,"No, please. Perhaps we can know you again on the battle, dear."
来吧，作为希腊主神，我也想看看你如今的实力究竟如何。,"Come on, as the Greek lord god, I cannot wait to see how powerful you are now."
扭转对手给自己带来的不利局面，再加以更猛烈的反击……,"Reverse the adverse situation brought by the opponent, and then fiercely lash back at the enemy."
不觉得熟悉么？这正是我在战场上最有效的战术策略。,Don't you feel familiar? It was my most effective tactical strategy on the battle.
几百年前那个温文尔雅的小姑娘，现在可真够暴力的……,"Hundreds of years ago, the little girl was debonair, but nowadays, she is quite violent..."
值得庆幸的是，她是希腊众神的同伴，而不是敌人。,"Fortunately, she is the companion of Greek gods, not the enemy."
欢迎回来，亲爱的，你或许比想象中更适合活跃在战场上。,"Welcome back, dear. You might be more suited to active on the battle than you thought."

呐，我说，只谈力气的话，你觉得我和丑牛谁更大些？,"Well, listen up, do you think who is stronger, Zodiac Ox or me?"
你对神明之间的战争怎么看？,What do you think of the wars among gods?
勇气与智慧你觉得哪个更强大？,"Which one do you think is more powerful, courage or wisdom?"
话说回来，你知道我和丑牛是怎样被召唤到这个世界来的么？,"Anyway, are you curious about how Zodiac Ox and I were summoned into this world?"
喂！你有中意的女孩子么？觉得我怎么样？,Hey! Is there any girl you like? How about me?
实在是太平淡了。,Fairly bland.
当然是勇气了！,"Courage, of course."
我不是很清楚……,I'm not clear...
我已经有喜欢的人了。,I do get a crush on someone.
呃……丑牛？,Uh... Zodiac Ox?
实在是太劲爆了！,Incredible!
应该是智慧吧？,Maybe... wisdom?
嗯，你挺可爱的。,Yeah... you're adorable.
哼哼！我就知道你会这么说，拼力气我还从来没输过谁。,Humph! I know the answer because I've never lost in terms of strength.
我也这么认为，在来到这个世界之前，我觉得你们打仗简直像小孩子过家家一般。,"I think so. Before I came to this world, I just thought those wars were as childish as kids' games."
嗯，勇敢的人往往能在磨练中变得睿智，但缺乏勇气的智慧在我看来只是小聪明罢了。,"Yeah, brave persons will tend to be wise after experiencing the trials, but the wisdom without courage seems like a petty trick."
虽然我还有想回去的念头，但我觉得这个世界更有意思……,"Although sometimes I still want to go back, this world is more interesting than the original land..."
哼哼！是吗？我对有竞争对手的恋爱可是一点也不讨厌呢！,Aha! Right? I'm not averse to competing with others for romance.
哼！看来你对我很没有信心啊！要我给你一拳，让你体验一下吗？！,Humph! It seems that you have no confidence in me! My punch will make you clear.
哼哼！等着瞧吧，这场众神大战真正劲爆的时刻，现在才刚刚开始！,"Humph! Just you wait, the climax of the wars among gods is coming sooner!"
是么？哼哼，我很有兴趣用拳头在你的脑袋上测试一下勇气和智慧哪个更强……,"Right? Well, I cannot wait to punch you on the head to test that which one is powerful, courage or wisdom..."
我觉得相对于猜，我更偏好用拳头得到答案呢，看招啦！！,I prefer knowing the answer with my punch to guessing something. Watch this!
我就知道你会这么说！我对自己的魅力还是很有自信的！,I knew you were gonna say that! I'm really confident of my charming!
啊……誓约真是一个很麻烦的仪式呢！有时间说这些誓词，不如早点回到战场上去把敌人打飞吧！,Uh... What a hassle! It's better to fight against rivals rather than make vows!

原出自于华夏神系“十二地支”中第三位的“虎”，其本身并非神明，但不知什么原因具备了异常恐怖的神能。\n与丑牛一样，在众神战争中经历了无数的磨练，使其力量足以和各大神系的主神级人物一较高下。,"Originally from the third Tiger in the Twelve Earthly Branches of the Chinese God. She was not a god but for some reason, she possessed an extremely terrifying power.\nJust like Zodiac Ox, she has experienced countless trials in the wars among gods so that she qualified to fight against the main gods."

这是什么地方……我为什么会被传送到这里来？！,Where is it... Why am I here?!
你是谁？！这场战斗不应该有陌生人插手才对……,Who are you?! This battle will not be related to any stranger.
看来你运气不好，亲爱的，偏偏此时出现在众神交战之地。,"You’re out of luck, dear, you happened to appear on the gods' battle land."
是召唤咒文出错的结果么，最近怎么总发生这种事……,"Anything wrong with summon spell, why is this happening all the time..."
呵，新来的家伙么？正好，我正觉得这场混战不够激烈呐！,"Hum, the new guy? Alright, I just think that this battle is not fierce enough."
哎……？打完了？我感觉自己还没出手你们就倒下了……,"Eh...? It’s over, right? It didn’t take me any strength to defeat you..."
你确实没怎么出手，但你的同伴在疯狂地向我们进攻……,"You didn’t attack us, but your fellows came at us like crazy..."
牺牲自己的生命从而提高团队的作战能力吗……,Sacrifice your own life to improve your team’s combat power...
哼，仅凭我自己的力量终究难以和形如一体的团队对抗……,"Humph, it’s really hard for me to defeat a united team..."
啊啦，看上去是个有趣的家伙呢，我记住你了，亲爱的。,"Ah, an interesting guy, I will remember you, dear."
黄道十二星座之一幻化而来的特殊神明，原本不具备神力，但众神无休止的战争让其神格化。\n她是所有星座中心地最仁慈的一个，对众神之间的战争非常反感，但其强大的信念和神力却让同伴安心。,"Capricornus is a special goddess transformed from one of the zodiac constellations. Originally lacking divine power, she was granted deification for her valor in endless wars.\nShe is the most merciful among the constellations. She has a strong aversion to the wars among gods, but her powerful faith and divine power can comfort fellows."
这个世界似乎比我想象中更危险，人类和众神就这么喜欢战争吗？,This world is more dangerous than I thought. Are human beings and gods fond of wars?
据说除了我以外，好像还有别的星座因为这次众神战争而被召唤而来？,It’s said that other constellations besides me have been summoned to this world because of the gods' war.
对战争感到厌倦的我，偏偏获得了如此强大的力量，这也是命运的玩笑吗？,"I’m indeed tired of wars, but I own this great power. That’s totally a joke of fate."
那个……你有喜欢的女孩子么？,Well... Do you fancy any girl?
占卜是我最擅长的了，需要我帮你预测一下未来吗？,I extremely excel at divination. Do you need me to predict your future?
如果有一天，你必须要在输掉一场战争和牺牲我之间做出选择，你会怎么做？,"If one day you have to choose between losing a war or sacrificing me, what will you do?"
战争是一种修行。,The war is also a kind of cultivation.
我有这种预感……,I have a feeling that...
接受命运也挺好。,"Accept your fate, not bad."
力量也能终结战争。,The power also can end the wars.
有啊，你猜猜是谁？,"Of course, have a guess."
目前暂时没有……,No one yet...
我想预测恋情……,I wanna predict my love...
我想预测战况。,I wanna predict the battle progress.
我不会让这事发生。,I'm not gonna let that happen.
那么我就更有必要和你一起去阻止这些无意义的争斗了，你觉得呢？,"Well, it’s necessary to work with you to stop the meaningless wars. What do you think?"
我始终期待着和平，虽然我承认在战场上和你经历生死一线的感觉挺不错的。,"I’m always eager about peace, though I admit that it’s pretty good to go through thick and thin together on the battlefront."
看来我有很长时间会挺孤独的，如果可以的话，希望您能多陪伴我一会儿……,"It seems that I will be lonely for a long time. If possible, I really hope that you can accompany me longer."
嗯……我觉得不管如何，多几个同伴总是好事。,Hmm... It’s good to have several friends no matter what happened.
或许是这样吧，至少命运让我遇见了你，在我心中没有比这更重要的事情了。,"Maybe you’re right. At least, thanks for the fate that I met you. No one can be more important than you in my mind."
你说的没错，我会好好使用命运所赐给我的力量，带给这个世界救赎的。,"Yeah, I will use my innate power in a proper way and bring salvation to the whole world."
你为什么一直盯着我看……你……你是在暗示什么吗……,Why are you always staring at me...Hmm...Are you hinting at me something?
真的？那么告诉我……你喜欢什么样的女孩子呢？,Really? So tell me please... What kind of girl do you fancy?
嗯，有结果啦！你会爱上长着羊角和鱼尾的……等……等下！我算错了！不是这样的！,"Ah, here’s the result! You’ll fall in love with someone who has the horn and the fishtail... Wait...wait a moment! That’s wrong! That’s not true."
嗯……结果显示……“自己才是自己最大的敌人”？这是什么意思？我的占卜出错了吗？,Hmm... The result shows that... “You are your own worst enemy” ? What’s the meaning? What’s wrong with my divination?
你不需要做出选择，因为到那时，我会替你做出选择的……,"You don’t need to choose any of them. At that moment, I will choose for you..."
是啊……我相信你，如果是你的话，一定有能力避免这种纠结的命运！,Yeah... I believe in you. You have the ability to avoid the tangled fate！
你知道么？誓约是一种牺牲 ，一种为彼此信念的牺牲。愿我的力量能与你结合，开创出我们所期待的世界。,"A vow is a kind of sacrifice, which means that from now on, we will live by one faith. I hope that our powers combine so that we can create a world worth fighting for."

仁慈不代表软弱，牺牲的代价换来的往往是令对手胆寒的力量，在以自我为祭品的献祭仪式完成之时，也是战场上的敌人陷入修罗炼狱之刻。,"Mercy doesn’t mean weakness. The individual sacrifice is for the daunting strength of the team to defeat the opponent. When the sacrificial ceremony with self sacrifice is completed, the enemy on the battlefield will be plunged into purgatory."

虽然我不一定能永远驻留于你所在的时空，但我以天使之名发誓，无论在何时何地，我与你的约定都会散发出永不消逝的光芒。,"I may not be stay by your side all the time, but I swear by the angel that our vow will shine forever, anywhere and anytime."
这个世界的米迦勒在做什么？她还在致力于解决与路西法以及魔物的争端吗？,What's Michael of this world doing? Is she still working on the dispute with Lucifer and monsters?
我始终不确定是否该解除与路西法的敌对关系，专注于维护平行时空的稳定。,I cannot still figure out if I should give up the hostile relationship between Lucifer and me. I'd better focus on maitaining the stability of the parallel universe.
我很庆幸能够成为第七神域的代言人之一，去解决各个平行时空的灾难。,I'm so glad to be one of the spokespersons belonging to the seventh domain to solve disasters in every parallel universe.
嗯……据我所知，你应该还没有了解过“第七神域”这个概念吧？,"Well, as I know, you have not figured out the concept of the seventh domain."
你相信象征正义的末日审判……终将在某个时刻到来么？,Do you believe that the doomsday judgement representing justice will come at some point.
当其他平行世界遭受灭顶之灾时，你能允许我离开你，去那里解决危机吗？,"When other parallel universes get into the catastrophe, would you allow me to leave here and solve the crisis?"
她一直如此。,She always has been so.
我认为应该这么做。,I suppose it should be like that.
什么是平行时空？,What's the parallel universe?
的确，和我说说看吧？,So would you like to tell me more about it?
会，这是一种荣耀。,"Yep, it's a kind of glory."
好像并不是这样。,It doesn't seem so.
我并不觉得这是好事。,I don't think so.
什么是第七神域代言人？,What's the spokesperson of the seventh domain?
不，我已经听你说过了。,"Nope, I have heard it from you."
希望不要，好像挺可怕。,I don't want that to happen. It seems horrible.
我或许会有些不舍。,Maybe I cannot bear to part with you.
嗯……也挺正常的，毕竟她和路西法可是水火不容的关系——至少在这个世界如此。,"Hmm...It's usual. After all, she and Lucifer are enemies like water and fire at least in this world."
你说的没错，毕竟我和她都即将要面对一个能够毁灭所有时空的、更强大的敌人……,You are right. We will face the more powerful enemy who can destroy the whole space time together.
嗯……你能想象一个和这里差不多的世界么？那个世界也有一个你，也在问我这个问题。,Hmm...Maybe you cannot image that there is another you in the similar world asking me the same question.
简单说，那里是所有平行世界的连接点，以及致力解决平行世界灾变的英雄所在之处。,"In a simple word, it is the junction where all parallel universes join together and it's also the place trying to arrange heroes to solve the catastrophe."
看来你已经做好了誓死对抗命运与灾厄的觉悟了呢，愿众天使的光芒与你同在。,It seems that you have gotten ready to resist the fate and the disaster. May the light of the angels be with you.
至少我向你承诺，不管我去哪个世界，都不会忘记和你在一起的这段时光。,"At least, I promise that I will never forget all the time staying with you wherever I am."
真让人意外！我还以为她会像当初那样，贯彻不把路西法亲手丢回地狱不罢休的理念。,"What a surprise! I thought that she was gonna stick to her principle of throwing Lucifer into the hell, like she always did before."
或许你是正确的吧，天使与恶魔结成同盟的可能性，恐怕比太阳从西边出来还小。,Maybe you are right. An alliance between angels and demons is less likely than the sun rising from the west.
维护所有平行世界的稳定，消灭可能引发时空混乱的危险因素，这就是代言人的职责。,"Maintaining the stability of all the parallel universes and eliminating all risk factors that will cause the space time chaos, which are the responsibility of the spokesperson."
嗯？奇怪，难道我把你和另一个平行世界的相同存在弄混了？,Eh? So weird. Did I confuse you with an identical being in another parallel universe?
审判来临时，你只会听见“BOOM！”的一声巨响，然后魔物就从这个世界上全部消失啦。,"When the doomsday judgement comes, all you'll hear a loud bang that sounds like BOOM! And then all the monsters will vanish forever."
如果终有一天我们分隔在两个时空，而你希望我回到身边时，我一定会回应你的呼唤。,"If one day we are separated into two parallel universes, I will do answer your call when you come back again."

元素精灵,Elemental Angels
温蒂妮,Undine
生命之源,Origin of Life
晶矿大师：当进驻晶石之泉时，提升晶石的产量。,"Spar Mine Master: When stationed at spar spring, increasing the productivity of spar	"
生命之源：提升所有上阵女神的生命值。,Origin of Life: Increase HP of all line-up angels
她是自然界四大元素中象征“宁静之水”的精灵，在经过祝祷的神圣泉水中，往往会见到她的诞生。她拥有着同族中最高的智慧和最冷静的性格，再大的麻烦对于她来说也不过是能够轻松解决的小事罢了。水元素的力量让她非常熟悉晶石的开发过程。此外，她还能为战场上的女神同伴提供强大的生命魔法支持。,"As one of the four major natural elementals, she represents tranquil water. Anyone who passes holy spring has the chance to witness her birth.She is the most intelligent and calmest one of her kindred, and no matter how big the trouble is, it is only a small case for her.Because of owning the power of water elemental, she is familiar with the spar development process. In addition, she can provide strong HP magic support for the angels on the battle."
幸会，吾乃水之精灵温蒂妮，遵从命运而被召唤而来。希望宁静之水能够给你带来众神的慈爱与恩惠。,"Nice to meet you. I'm water elemental, Undine, following the call of fate. May tranquil water bring you the gods' benevolent affections and grace."
需要为你做个祷告吗？虽然不能一同面对敌人，但作为水之精灵，我所带来的生命之力将始终与你同在。,"Do you need me to pray for you? We cannot face enemies together, but the life power I brough to you will always be with you."
你也会对大自然萌生喜爱之心么？我以为人类只会对自己同类抱持这样的情感呢……,Do you favor nature as well? I presumed human beings only care about their own fellows.
水虽然显得柔弱，但其实是非常难以征服的存在，不信的话，你可以试试用拳头重击水面是什么感觉。,"Water seems delicate, but in fact, it's really hard to conquer. If you don't believe it, just try to pound the water with your fist."
沙拉曼妲,Salamandra
愤怒之源,Essence of Anger
火焰亲和：当进驻熔岩池时，提升强化精华的产量。,"Flame Affinity: When stationed at the Lava Lake, increasing the productivity of Enhance Essence"
愤怒之源：提升所有上阵女神的攻击力。,Essence of Anger: Increase ATK of all line-up angels
她是自然界四大元素中象征“炽烈之火”的精灵，火山、熔岩池是她最常诞生的地方，但据说她也会从壁炉中出现。相对于冷静地思考解决问题的方法，她更倾向于用直白、单纯的手段——如果暴力能解决问题的话。她擅长从熔岩池中提炼出强化精华。同时她也擅长于将自身源于火焰的愤怒转化为能量，提供给战场上的众神。,"As one of the four major natural elementals, she represents blazing fire. Not only does she come from the volcano and lava, but also she may come from the fireplace. Instead of thinking calmly about how to solve the problems, she prefers to take the direct and simple measures—violence. She's good at extracting enhance essence from lava lake. Meanwhile, she does well in converting her flaming anger into energy provided for angels on the battle."
啊啦？没想到区区人类……竟然敢召唤我这位象征大自然愤怒的火元素精灵，挺有胆量的嘛……,"Aha? I still cannot believe that as the fire elemental, I will be summoned by the human being one day. How dare you!"
能感受到烈焰带来的能量吗？可惜我没办法离开结界，不然我只要动动手指，就能替你把敌人烧成灰。,"Can you feel the energy from the flame?  Unfortunately, I cannot leave the enchantment, or I just move my fingers then the enemies will be incinerated."
相对于潮湿而凉爽的森林，或许还是炽热的熔岩地带更适合我，你觉得呢？,"Compared with damp and cool forest, the broiling lava is a better place for me. what do you think?"
火元素精灵都是天生的工匠，给我一个火山口，我就能帮你提炼出价值连城的火焰精华。,"The fire elemental is a born craftsman. Give me a volcanic crater, I will return you the priceless flame essence."
幻兽诺姆,Gnome
坚毅之源,Unswerving Core
宝石炼金术：当进驻宝石研究室时，提升宝石的产量。,"Gem Alchemy: When stationed at gem lab, increasing the productivity of gem"
坚毅之源：提升所有上阵女神的防御力。,Unswerving Core: Increase DEF of all line-up angels
她是自然界四大元素中象征“永恒之土”的精灵，一切山脉、土壤以及森林中都可能诞生她。她性格稳重、成熟而有魅力，平时会很友善且平和地对待其他种族，但这并不意味着她们对战斗的技巧一无所知。由于对土壤的了解和亲和度非常高，她能够轻易找到宝石矿脉的所在，也能够为同伴们提供优秀的防护魔法。,"As one of the four major natural elementals, she represents eternal earth and may be born in any mountain, soil and forest.She is not only calm, mature and charming, but also always friendly and gentle with other races, which doesn't mean that she knows nothing about the combat skills.Because of her affinity with the earth, it's quite easy for her to find the gem mine and protect fellows with her excellent protection spells."
哟……幸会，旅行者，感谢众神指引我们命运的交汇，愿大地之灵赐予您胜利与荣耀。,"Hey...traveller, glad to see you. Thank the gods for guiding our fates together. May the spirit of earth grant you victory and glory."
您为什么一直盯着我看？难道是……希望我给您一个充实而满足的拥抱么？呵呵……,"Why do you always stare at me? You're looking forward a full and satisfied hug from me, aren't you? Haha..."
大地的力量代表着坚固而永恒，哪怕面对最强力的进攻，也将赐予你滴水不漏的保护！,"The power of earth represents firmness and eternity. Even facing the strongest attack, it will offer a unassailable protection to you."
作为土元素的精灵，诺姆也是大地丰饶的象征。喂……今晚有兴趣来我的房间，好好“开垦”一下我的身体吗？,"As the earth elemental, Gnome is also the symbol of rich and fertile resource. Hey...do you want to come to my bedroom tonight? I guess you'll be interested in exploring my body."
希尔芙,Sylva
灵动之源,Ethereal Origin
神核祷文：当进驻神核祭坛时，提升神核的产量。,"Holy Core Prayer: When placed in the Holy Core Shrine, increasing the production of Holy Core"
灵动之源：提升所有上阵女神的破防等级。,Ehereal Origin: Incease DEF.PEN level of all line-up angels
她是自然界四大元素中象征“飘渺之风”的精灵，一切花丛、草原等季风时常吹拂的地方，都会有她的身影。她性格活泼而自我，对文明社会中没有接触过的人和事都怀有非常重的好奇心，但也常常因此而惹出事端。她与天空的连接非常紧密，很多传闻中风精灵是神明与人类之间传递神谕的使者。,"As one of the four major natural elementals, she represents ethereal wind. She appears in all flowers and meadows where the monsoon blows.She is lively, egotistical and curious about anything that she has never met in the civilized society. But for this reason, she's always involved in troubles.She is close to the sky. It's said that the water elemental is the messager of sending orcales between human beings and gods."
哼哼！人类，看来你的运气不错呢！召唤伟大的风之精灵希尔弗有什么事吗？,"Aha! Human, it seems that you're fortunate enough! What's the matter? Why did you summon the great winter elemental Sylva?"
在自然界的四大精灵中，只有伟大的希尔弗能够和神明直接对话呢！是不是很了不起啊？,"Among the four major elementals in nature, only the great Stlva is qualifed to talk with gods! It's terrific, isn't it?"
我……我才没有因为你一直盯着我看而不好意思呢！反正你也只会对土元素诺姆那样的身材感兴趣吧，哼！,"I...I'm not shy that you keep staring at me! Anyway, you're just interested in the Gnome's figure. Humph!"
伟大的风之精灵希尔弗的速度可没人能追得上……等等！你坏笑什么呐？！你是不是在想我逃跑时候的样子？！,No one can chase up the great Sylva... Wait! Why are you smiling inexpressibly?! Are you imaging the scene of escape?

哼哼！这么有自信的吗？如果你输了的话，就得陪我在海滩约会一整天哦！,"Hump! Why are you so confident? If you are failed, you need to date me on the beach all day."

那些为追求爱情而牺牲一切的人，你会怎么看待他们呢？,What do you think of people who sacrifice everything for love?
在人类看来，爱情终究是一种可以用金钱来衡量的存在吗？,"From the human standpoint, love is something that they can put a price on, isn't it?"
无论是恋爱还是战争，先发制人都是明智之举，你觉得呢？,"In love or war, it's wise to strike first. Don't you think so?"
这个时代神与人之间的爱，因为身份有别，好像依旧难以被世人所接受……,"At this time, it's still difficult for the world to accept the fact that god and humans would fall in love, just because the identity of god is different from that of humans."
在我没有降临世界前，丘比特那个孩子有好好忠于自己的神职吗？,"Was the kid, Cupid, faithful to her obligation before I came to this world?"
喜欢艺术品么？觉得雕塑这门艺术怎么样？,Are you fond of artwork? How do you like sculptures?
他们很勇敢！,How brave they are!
或许确实如此……,Maybe that's right...
我总是主动的一方。,I always take the initiative.
这确实很遗憾……,It's definitely a pity...
她还挺认真的。,She really did a great job.
不是很懂雕塑……,I know nothing about the sculpture...
他们太天真……,They're quite naive...
至少我不这么认为。,"At least, I don't think so."
我其实习惯静观其变……,"Actually, I get used to taking a wait-and-see approach."
我并不在意身份的差别。,I don't care about identity differences.
她好像有些偷懒……,She doesn't seem to do well.
我挺擅长雕塑的。,I'm good at sculpturing.
如你所言，即便他只是凡人，我也会为他的勇气，而毫不吝啬地降下爱与力量的恩赐。,"As you say, if he were only mortal, I would bestow the gifts of love and strength upon him for his courage"
好吧，看来我要解决的麻烦又多了一个——让人们重新认识爱情的价值。,"Well, it seems that another trouble needs to handle. Let me reshape people's view of love."
哦？那么要不要今晚来我的房间，让我感受一下你有多“主动”？,Really? Would you like to come to my bedroom tonight? It's a great opportunity to show your initiative.
不管如何，我都会期待所有人抛弃身份枷锁，追求自己所爱之人的那一天到来。,"Anyway, I still look forward to one day when we all throw off our identity and pursue our true love."
真是挺让我意外呢！我原以为她的性格只会把这个世界的恋情弄得一团糟……,I'm so surprised! I thought that she would screw up affection affairs in this world with her personality.
我听说无数人类的艺术家都曾为我立过雕像，但我最希望看到的……还是你的作品。,"I've heard that countless artists made sculptures of me, but your artwork is the one that I'm most looking forward to."
是吗？我很有兴趣看看，将来有一天你遇到中意的人时，会天真到什么程度呢……,Really? It will be interesting to see how naive you will be when you meet the right person someday.
嗯，我想……这也是为什么我最终会选择降临在你身边的原因吧。,"Well, I presume...that's why I choose to be with you in the end."
让我猜猜……你是希望从我这里听到令人期待的告白吗，亲爱的？,"Let me guess...Are you eager to hear my self-revealing words, dear?"
你比我想象中要乐观呢……愿你能够改变这个陈旧的世界，重新塑造人与神的关系。,You are more optimistic than I thought...May you be able to change this old world and reshape the relationship between humans and God.
啊……这并不奇怪，如果她是个称职的爱神，我也就不会被这个世界召唤到此了。,"Aha...It's met my expectations. If she was qualified enough, I won't be summoned to this world."
那么你有兴趣以我为题材创作一件作品吗？呵呵……告诉我，你喜欢怎样的姿势呢？,"So would you like to make a piece about me? Tell me, what kind of pose do you like?"
这份誓约签下之时，我们的思想也彼此交融了呢！让我看看你在想什么……啊啦，原来你一直对我有这么刺激而大胆的欲望吗……亲爱的？,"When we made this vow, our minds mingled, and I could read your thoughts. Have you always had such wild and daring desires for me, my dear?"
爱神之冠,Crown of Love
无名艺术家所创造的金色冠冕，蕴含着对美的无限遐想，以及对爱神如痴似醉的迷恋，其中灌注着由感情升华而来的、无与伦比的魔力。,"The golden crown made by the unknown artist contains the infinite fantasy of beauty and the infatuation with the goddess of love, which is infused with the inimitable magic from the sublimation of emotion."

神话中的爱与情欲之神，传闻丘比特是她的后代，两位神明共同主宰世间的姻缘。\n她几乎在所有文明中都受到尊敬，这也给她带来了不可想象的神能。她虽然反感因权力而起的战乱，却赞扬为爱而做出的牺牲。,"Venus is the mythological goddess of love and lust and Cupid is said to be her offspring. The two goddesses jointly rule the marriage of the world.\nShe is respected in almost all the civilizations, which grants her unimaginable divine power. Although she opposes the war caused by power conflicts, she praises the sacrifices made for love."

你总算来了，再迟几天这个世界会发生什么我可真不敢想。,"Here you are, finally. I cannot imagine how the world will be going without you."
真令人感动，才几个世纪不见，你就已经这么想念我了？,So touching. Have you missed me so much that we were just apart for a few centuries?
其实是我们遇到麻烦了，不得已才召唤前辈您来帮忙。,"Actually, we met the trouble. So we had summoned you to do us a favor."
详细的事之后再说，眼下或许要先帮爱神姐姐“热热身”？,Why don't we warm up first and catch up later?
我刚降临这个世界，就要做这么刺激的事情吗，亲爱的？,"I've just been here for a few seconds. Are we about to do something thrilling, my dear?"
对爱的化身暴力相向，大多数结果都会变成自讨苦吃……,"Most of the time, the person pays the penalty for their violence against the embodiment of love..."
你的力量没有丝毫削弱，看来这次的麻烦还有办法解决。,"Your strength is not weakened, so it seems there is a way out of this trouble."
让我猜猜……难道是丘比特这孩子惹出什么事了？,Let me guess...Did Cupid make some trouble?
前辈猜对啦，她好像不小心挑起了北欧与希腊的众神战争。,You're right. She accidentally provoked the war of gods between Northern Europe and Greece.
好吧……一点也不意外，毕竟她几个世纪前就是这性格……,"Well, that's not surprising...She is still as same as what she was centuries ago."
等……等一下，您为什么会被召唤到这个世界来……,"Gosh...Why were you here, your highness?"
你玩的挺开心嘛，见到我是不是很惊讶，亲爱的？,"You're having fun, aren't you? Surprised to see me again, honey?"
听说北欧和希腊的神明关系被你弄砸了，差点大打出手？,It's said that you messed up the relationships among the gods from Northern Europe and Greece and almost got them into the fight.
不是这样的！其实我只是和众神开了个小玩笑而已！,Absolutely not! I just play a joke on them.
“开了个小玩笑”是吗？看来坏孩子需要教训一下呢。,"A joke Right? I'm gonna teach you a lesson, little rascal."
不打啦，再打下去你都快哭了，老实交代你的恶作剧如何？,"It seems that you gonna cry. Well, I will stop, if you tell me about the prank honestly."
呜……我只想试试，自己的箭能否影响最强大的神明而已。,Oww...I just wanna see whether my arrows can influence the most powerful goddess or not.
喔？所以赫拉大人就荣幸地成为了你的实验品，是吗？,"Oh? So Lord Hera was unfortunate to be your guinea pig, wasn't she?"
我发誓这只是个意外，我从没想让事情发展成这样。,I swear it was an accident. I never meant for it to go this way.
这种意外不会再有了，因为从今往后我会好好盯着你的……,"It won't happen again, because from now on I will keep my eyes on you."

我听说奥丁已经被召唤到这个世界很长时间了？,I heard that Odin has been summoned to this world for a long time
话说回来，赫拉最近怎么样？我猜这个世界应该不会让她感到无聊……,"By the way, how's Hera, I don't think she will kill her time in this world…"
原以为没有我的希腊众神只会是一盘散沙，没想到你的指挥能力远在我之上。,"I thought the Greek Gods will be in a state of disunity, but I didn't expect your excellent command ability."
你觉得神与人之间，终究隔着难以逾越的距离吗？,Do you think there is an insurmountable distance between God and man after all?
战争在我看来，只不过是强者之间的消遣罢了，你怎么看？,"From where I stand, warfare is a recreational activity between the strong, do you think so?"
众神之王这个头衔，在你的眼里有多重的分量呢？,How important it is to become the Supreme Deity
她对你不大满意……,She's not happy with you…
其实并不容易。,It's not easy.
恐怕的确如此。,I'm afraid so.
战争是一种试炼。,War tests us.
是很珍贵的荣耀。,It's a glory worth valuing.
呃……我不大清楚。,"ehh,I'm not sure actually."
她过得挺自在的。,She leads a comfortable life.
我确实很有信心。,I am confident.
我并不这么认为。,I don't think so.
战争是一场灾难……,War is a disaster for all of us.
大概只是个虚名？,More of a title.
我想是时候去“拜访”一下了，少了我这个对手，她应该已经快无聊到爆炸了。,"I guess it's time to visit her. Without me as an opponent, life would bore her to death."
是吗？看来她的嫉妒心一点没减，这个世界没被她炸了可真是个奇迹……,Is that so? It seems that she is as jealous as she used to be. It's literally a miracle that she has not exploded the world.
我从没想过一个凡人出身的存在能有这么高的智慧和个人魅力，真是让我惊讶。,"I'm impressed by the man with such wisdom and charisma, which is beyond my cognition."
或许是吧，如果真的人神有别，我大不了放弃神格，当个和你一样的凡人也挺不错的。,"Maybe it is what it is. If there's any difference between human and God, it won't be bad for me to abandon the God identity and become a human like you."
你的回答让我想起了成为希腊主神之前的那段战争时期，很有挑战，但也挺有趣。,Your answer reminds me of the wartime before I became the Supreme Deity in Greek. Challenging yet interesting.
我很高兴你能如此看重这份荣耀，它凝聚了我作为神明的尊严与责任。,"I'm glad that you regard this glory as something important, which embodies my responsibility and dignity as a goddess."
嗯？我好像闻到了谎言的味道，以我的洞察力而言，她化成灰我也找得到在哪，呵呵……,emm? Lies are showing up. My insight can guide me to where she is even she's turned into ashes. Haha…
哈哈……看起来你比我更懂如何和她相处，不是么？,"Haha, you seem to be better at going along with her than me, is that so?"
倒也没错，不然我也不会认同你作为希腊众神的最高统帅。,"Right, otherwise I won't acknowledge you as the chief ruler of all Gods in Greek."
喔？呵呵……那么今晚有没有兴趣到我的房间……看看我和你的距离能近到什么程度？,oh? What do you think about coming over my room tonight and seeing how intimate we really are?
那么你打算怎样结束这场灾难呢，我的英雄？,"Then what's your plan for ending the disaster, my hero?"
那么你一定找到了比这个头衔更珍贵的事物吧？能告诉我是什么吗？,You must have found something more cherishable then the title? Could you tell me what it is?
从神话时代起就没有任何人有资格与我签订这个誓约，但不管怎么说，幸运的家伙，你是我唯一的例外。,You are the first person in ages to be worthy of making a vow with me.
雷霆权杖,Thunder Scepter
由独眼巨人打造，即便是再强悍的神明也会为其力量所惊叹，闪电是希腊王权的象征，这柄权杖曾帮助宙斯获得了无数场象征荣耀与尊严的胜利。,"Crafted by the Cyclops, even the most powerful gods will be amazed by its power. Lightning is a symbol of Greek royalty, and this scepter has helped Zeus win countless victories that symbolize glory and dignity."

宙斯被称为“奥林匹斯之王”，同时也是天空与雷电之神，强大程度几乎位于各大神系的顶峰。\n据说是为了与奥丁争夺众神之王的位置而被召唤到这个世界的，但没人知道她真正的目的和意图。,"Zeus, known as the Ruler of Olympus, is the goddess of the sky and thunder, and her power is almost at the peak of the major gods. \nIt is said that she was summoned to this world to compete with Odin for the position of ruler of the gods, but no one knows her real purpose and intentions."
宙斯碎片5个,5 Zeus Shards
宙斯UR碎片5个,5 Zeus UR Shards
宙斯UR碎片,Zeus UR Shard
嗯？神话时代我好像都没有见过这么大的欢迎场面……,Ok? I don't think I've ever be welcomed like this in the age of mythology…
呐，亲爱的，你为什么会觉得我们的阵势是在欢迎你呢？,"Now, dear, what makes you feel that you are welcomed?"
有些过去的旧账，我觉得可能要和宙斯阁下您算算……,"Some old grudges from the past, I think you may have to settle with you…"
比如重新决定众神之王的位置，以及海、地、冥界的归属。,"For example, re-determining who's the ruler of the gods, and the ownership of the sea, the earth, and the underworld."
我也正好有些无趣，或许是时候测试一下新觉醒的力量了。,"I just happened to be a little bored, maybe it's time to test the power of the new awakening."
真是太令人遗憾了，竟然没有一个人能和我打上十回合……,It's such a shame that all of you are defeated in 10 rounds...
看来我觉醒的雷霆之力还够统治希腊众神几个世纪。,It seems that the power of thunder I have awakened is enough to rule the Greek gods for centuries.
真是难以理解，这么长时间，您的力量也丝毫没有减弱……,It's insane that your power has not weakened in the slightest...
很快，我猜这个世界的格局和命运应该会有新的变化……,"Soon, I guess there would be new changes in the landscape and destiny of this world..."
你猜对啦，那么接下来回答我一个问题吧：奥丁在哪？,"You are right, answer me: where is Odin?"
宙斯？！这不可能，我没有观测到你降临这个世界的命运！,"Zeus? ! This is impossible, I did not observe the fate of your coming to this world!"
看来你的眼神比以前糟糕了啊，奥丁。,"It seems your eyesight are worse than before, Odin."
这么久没见，不觉得你众神之王的称号少了些挑战吗？,"Haven't seen you for so long, don't you think your title of Ruler of the Gods is a little less challenging?"
这名头确实让我有些腻了，不过得看你有没有本事取回去。,"This title kinda bores me, you want it back? Come and defeat me."
很快就会有答案了，我相信你会怀念震耳欲聋的雷电声的。,"There will be an answer soon, and I'm sure you'll miss the deafening sound of thunder."
你觉醒的力量比几千年前更强大了，真让我惊讶……,"Shocking, Your awakening power is stronger than it was thousands of years ago..."
我也挺意外，不过获得这份力量大概也是命运的安排吧。,"I was surprised too, but I guess it's my fate to own the power."
看来潘多拉那个家伙预言得没错，这个世界有麻烦了。,"It seems that Pandora's prediction is right, the world is in trouble."
是吗？我希望给世界带来麻烦的人最好别是我。,Yeah? I hope it's better not me who's causing trouble for the world.
谁知道，你顺应召唤而降临，或许是救世主也说不定……,"Who knows, you follow the call and come, maybe it is the savior of the world..."

我不想独自度过那漆黑的长夜，所以，你会陪着我的，是吗？,"I don't want to spend that long dark night alone, so you'll be by my side, right?"
越危险的，越迷人！你也这么认为吗？,Danger is always accompanied by charm! Don't you think so?
我是不是和其他的神明不太一样？,Am I different from other deities?
为人处世不必太严肃，身为神明，最重要的就是及时行乐！你觉得呢？,"There's no need to be too serious. As a deity, the most important thing is to seize the day! What do you think?"
作为众神之主的妹妹可真是麻烦，奥丁的掌控欲太强了！,"As the sister of Supreme Deity, Odin is a real trouble. She wants to control everything!"
战斗对我而言就是一场游戏，反正到最后胜利的一方，都会是我！,"The battle is a game to me, and in the end, I'll be the one who wins anyway!"
嗯，我一定会的。,"Yes, I will."
我也这么觉得！,I see!
是不太一样！,It's not quite the same!
我认可你的想法。,I agree with you.
我也不喜欢被管控的感觉。,I don't like the feeling of being controlled either.
你真有自信！,You have so much confidence!
这……我还有其它事情要做。,This ...... I have other things to do.
我不这么觉得,We do not see eye to eye.
没有什么不一样啊！,Nothing is different!
我觉得凡事还是较真点好！,I think it's better to be serious about everything!
有个姐姐挺好的。,It's good to have a sister.
战斗还是需要认真一点。,The battle still requires prudence.
我就知道，你一定会陪着我的。那我也，还你一个美妙的夜晚吧！,I know that you would be there for me.Then you'll be granted a wonderful night!
哦！你在害怕什么呢？是担心会沦陷于我的美色之中吗？,Oh! What scares you?Is it the fear of being allured by my beauty?
与众不同才是我的原则！你一定也喜欢这样的我吧？,"Being unique is my motto! You must like me, right?"
总算有一个和我想法相同的人了！我想我们之间会相处得很愉快的。,"Finally, I find someone who just has the same thoughts as me! I think we'll get along very well."
看来我们是同一种人，都喜欢自由自在的生活。,"I guess we're the same kind of people, we both enjoy freedom."
没错！我对于自己的实力，就像对自己的美貌一样自信！,That's right! I'm as confident in my strength as I am in my beauty!
居然拒绝了我的邀约，你果然跟其他人不一样，我对你更加感兴趣了！,"How dare you refuse my invitation, no one has ever turned down my invitation! I'm interested in you even more."
那就不要犹豫了，快过来大胆地拥抱我吧！,"Then don't hesitate, come and hug me!"
难道你不觉得，我比其他女神更美吗？,Don't you think that I'm uncomparable in appearance?
原来你是个严肃的人啊？那我希望，你在和我相处的时候，可以轻松愉快一点。,"So you're a serious person, huh? Then I hope that you can be a little more relaxed when you're with me."
那既然这样的话，我来做你最亲爱的姐姐怎么样？,"In that case, how about I becoming your sister?"
哦！你是在担心我吗？放心，我可不忍心让你为我伤心的。,"Oh! Are you worried about me? Don't worry, I can't bear to let you down."
我总是想让所有人都为我的魅力所折服，却没想到，自己有一天会折服在你的魅力之下。你可真是我最大的意外啊！,"I enjoy making everyone fall under my charm, but I never imagined that I would fall under yours. You are full of surprises!"
命运神骰,Divine Dice of Destiny
阿萨神域的禁忌神器，据说其中蕴含着改变神族命运的力量。是生存，还是毁灭，一切都隐藏在这枚神骰之中。,"The forbidden artifact of the Asa Divine Realm, which is said to be powerful enough to change the fate of deities. Whether it is survival, or destruction, everything is hidden in this divine dice."
限定专属：洛基,Exclusive Limited: Loki
洛基碎片,Loki Shard
集齐55个洛基碎片可以召唤洛基,Collect 55 Loki Shards to summon Loki!
北欧神话中的恶作剧与诡计之神，亦是火神。原本是巨人族出身，因与奥丁交好而加入阿萨神族。\n她生性狡诈，要捉弄其他神祇，因此与众神交恶，是引发诸神黄昏的重要人物之一。,"The deity of mischief and trickery in Norse mythology, as well as  the deity of fire. Originally a giant, she joined Asa because of her friendship with Odin.\nBy her cunning nature, she wanted to play tricks on other deities, while being excluded by other deities. She was one of the important figures who triggered the twilight of the deities."

哎呀呀！居然有这么多人在欢迎我的到来吗？,Oops! Are there so many people welcoming me?
为什么连这家伙也被召唤过来了，见到他我就感到非常的生气！,Why was this guy summoned here? I hate him!
总算有一个和我一样，被世人冠以恶名的家伙出现了吗？,"Finally, a guy who has been given a bad name by the world, just like me, has appeared?"
我亲爱的姐妹！这个世界并不友好，没有足够的力量是无法被认可的！,"My dear sister! This world is not friendly, and you won't be welcomed without supreme power!"
你们这些家伙，可真是不念旧情啊！那我就展示一下我全新的力量，用实力让你们来认可我吧！,"You guys, you are so ungrateful! Then I'll upturn your prejudice and use my strength to make me myself acknowledged!"
北欧神族的阵营又加入了新的成员吗？让我来见识一下你的力量，看看你能为北欧神族提升多少战力！,A new member in the camp of the Nordic Deities? Let me see your power and see how much you can boost the Nordic Gods' power!
连希腊神族的主神都亲自来欢迎我了，我的面子还真大啊！,"Even the Supreme Greek Deity has come to welcome me personally, I've got a lot of face!"
世人都将我们称之为“邪恶的神”，那就看看我们两个之间，谁的力量更加强大吧！,"The world calls us evil deities, we'll see who's more powerful!"
第一邪神的名头你拿去好了！不过这场战斗我一定要赢！,You can take the title of the number one evil god! I will win the battle!
洛基，没想到连你被召唤过来了，那正好可以了结我们往日的恩怨了。,"Loki, I didn't expect that even you were summoned here, and it's time to end our old grudge."
你可真是个记仇的家伙，千年前的恩怨还记得这么清楚！那我就陪你痛快地打一架，了结往日的恩怨吧！,"You're a vengeful guy, you still remember the grudge from a thousand years ago so clearly! Then I will fight with you to settle the old grudge!"
我愚蠢的妹妹啊！这个世界有着太多的危险存在！如果你还是抱着游戏人生的态度，我劝你还是赶紧返回阿萨神域去吧！,"My stupid sister! World's been dangerous! If you still want to slack off your life, you'd better return to the Asa domain!"
你还是这么古板啊！我的姐姐，跟千年前相比，你一点都没变，可是我却已经变得跟你一样强大了！,"You are still so old-fashioned! My sister, you  aren exactly who you've been a thousand years ago, but I've become as powerful as you!"
那就让我好好见识一下，你这一千年来的改变吧！,Then let me see how much you've changed in the past thousand years!

肩负重任的感觉，有时也会很沉重！,Sometimes the responsibilities feel heavy on me.
在追求最强力量的道路上，我永远不会停歇。,I will never stop pursuing the greatest power.
只要有我在，邪恶的巨人就永远别想踏入阿斯加德神域一步！,Never will an evil giant set foot in Asgard as long as I am alive.
雷神之锤给我带来了强大的力量，但这种力量有时就连我自己也感到害怕。,"My Mjolnir brought mighty power to me, but I also fear its powerfulness sometimes."
我北欧神族第一战士的威名，难道只是用敌人的鲜血来铸造的吗？,It is not only because I killed so many that made me the number one warrior of Nordic Deities.
我一直在想，赢得战斗的关键，是在于强大的力量，还是高超的智慧？,I am always wondering what the key to winning a battle is? Strong body or great mind?
但那是一份无与伦比的荣耀。,But it is an exceptional glory.
你已经是最强的战士了！,You are already the strongest warrior!
让巨人们颤抖吧！,Let the giants tremble under my mighty power!
这股力量只有你能掌控。,You are the only one who can control this power.
那是敌人对你的认可。,That's the best recognition you can get from your enemies.
最重要的还是力量。,Power is the most important thing to have.
我想帮你分担压力。,I want to share your burden.
也要注意劳逸结合。,You must keep the balance between work and rest.
如果可以和平解决那更好了。,That will be wonderful if we can have a peaceful settlement.
这是上天的恩赐。,This is a godsend blessing.
不！那是你强大神力的体现。,"No! It is, in fact, the reflection of your mighty power."
最关键的还是智慧。,The key is to have a great mind.
你说的没错，对于我而言，没有什么比荣耀更重要。,"You are right. For me, nothing is more important than glory."
能够获得你的认可，对于我而言，是最大的荣耀。,To be recognized by you is the greatest glory of all.
总有一天，我会将它们全部驱逐干净！,"Some day, I will eliminate them altogether!"
但愿这种力量，不会有失控的一天。,I hope I will not lose control of my power one day.
对于这种认可我很欣慰，不过我不希望在别人的眼里，我是一个嗜杀的人。,"I am so glad with your recognition. However, I don't want to be seen as a bloodthirsty goddess."
我对于自己现在的力量，很有自信！,I am confident in the strength I possess.
谢谢你！跟你在一起，我觉得一下子轻松了很多。,I appreciate your presence. Being with you really takes my edge off.
或许你说的没错，偶尔的休息，是为了到达更远的地方。,Maybe you are right. Taking a break every now and then is a must to reach further away.
如果可以和平解决，那自然是再好不过！只是想跟那群邪恶的巨人谈判，这根本做不到。,"It couldn't be better if we could settle it peacefully. However, it is impossible to negotiate with those evil and irrational giants."
所以我从出生以来，也肩负着来自上天的使命。,"Since I was born, I was granted missions of gods."
你说的对！我更希望，我的威名是建立在我自身的力量之上。,You are right. I would much like to build my prestige on my own power.
你说的有道理！不管是在力量方面，还是在智慧方面，我都要做到最强！,That's a good point! I have to be strong in both mind and body!
在其他人面前，我展现的都是无比强大的力量，但只有在你面前，我才会展现自己温柔的一面。希望我们能携手并肩，一起为这个世界带来安宁与和平！,"In the presence of others, I demonstrate only my mighty power. But only before you will I show my gentleness. I hope we can join hands and bring peace to this world!"
雷神之锤,Thor's Mjolnir
雷神之锤是阿萨神族威力最为强大的武器。它的锤头是由阿斯加德神域最坚硬的钢铁所打造，握柄部分则是以世界之树的木材作成。它可以砸碎任何东西，将其扔出去，击中目标之后还会自动飞回持有者的手中。,"Mjolnir is the strongest weapon of all weapons in Aesir. Its hammerhead is forged with the hardest steel in Asgard, and its handle is made of the body of Yggdrasil. It can smash anything with one strike. No matter how far it flies, it would always find its way back to the holder's hand."

太好了，连索尔也被召唤过来了！以后我们可以继续并肩作战，也可以相互切磋，磨砺自己的实力了。,"Great! Now that Thor is summoned here, we could fight alongside and learn from one another to improve our power."
我的姐妹，欢迎你的到来！我们北欧神族的实力又得到了巨大的提升。,"My dear sister, I give you my warmest welcome. The power of Nordic Deities will definitely reach another level."
哎！没想到这家伙也跟着来了，以后的日子怕是没那么潇洒了！,Geez! I didn't expect her to be here. I guess my days of fun have officially ended.
全新的力量并没有那么容易掌控！索尔，你准备好接受我们的历练了吗？,"This new power is a little hard to control. Thor, are you ready to take this quest?"
接受历练是掌控全新力量的必要流程，我早已做好准备，开始吧！你们不用手下留情！,"I knew if you want to master a new kind of power, you must go through a trial. I am ready. Let's get started! Don't go easy on me."
我很好奇，做为北欧神族的第一战士，你究竟觉醒了何种全新的力量！,"I am curious, as the number one warrior of the Nordic Deities, what kind of new power you have awakened."
那就让你见识一下，这无与伦比的神力吧！,Then let me show you how strong this mighty power is.
我们已经好久没有切磋过了！如果战胜不了我的话，你北欧神族第一战士的名头可要归我了！,It has been long since our last fight. I will take your title if you lose!
嘿！想夺走我第一战士的名号，可没那么容易！,"Humph, you want to take my title? Bring it!"
你以前就经常坏我好事，没想到我们在这个世界又相遇了！这一次，你可别再跟我过不去了！,You used to spoil my plan all the time. I am surprised to meet you again here. You better not bother me this time!
洛基！收起你的恶作剧，我们还可以做朋友。不然的话，以后我照样会阻止你。,"Loki! Stop your pranking things, and then we can be friends. Or you will taste the fruit of standing against me in the future."
真是个无趣的家伙！看来我们只能再较量一场了，要是你输了的话，那就赶紧返回阿斯加德神域去吧！,"What a dull guy! It seems we have to rematch once. If you lose, pack your things and get back to Asgard."
索尔！做为北欧神族最强的战力，我对你寄予着最高的期望。所以，我对你的考验，也会是前所未有的严厉！,"Thor! As the most powerful Nordic Deities, I have high hopes for you. So, as the test assigned by me, this will be an unprecedented challenge."
来吧！我所期待的，正是最严厉的考验！,Come on! What I am expecting will always be the toughest trial!

破灭之爪：提升所有上阵女神的抗性穿透能力。,Smashing Crawl: Increase the RES PEN of all Line-up angels
哈提和斯库尔是巨狼族首领的两个女儿，也是一对双生子。她们从出生之时起，就在进行着最残酷的试炼——追逐太阳和月亮，吸收日之力和月之力，强化自身力量，从而成为族群里最巅峰的强者。而哈提和斯库尔也不负众望，她们天赋异禀，在年复一年的试炼当中，实力飞速成长，已然成为种族中的佼佼者。,"Hati and Sköll are the twin daughters of the leader of the Giant Wolf clan. From the day they were born, they were sent to the most formidable trial—chasing the sun and the moon to absorb their energy so as to strengthen their power.\nHati, and Sköll had lived up to the expectations. They are not only gifted but also grow more and more potent in the trial years after years. Finally, they have become the strongest of their clan."
哈提：我追逐了那么多年的月亮，但直到今天，哈提才追逐到了自己真正的主人。\n斯库尔：以后，你就是我的主人，我心目中真正的太阳！,"Hati: I have been chasing the moon for so long. But today, I have met my true master.\nSköll: From now on, you are my master, the true sun of my mind."
每到下雨天，我就感觉做什么事都不起劲，我还是喜欢在灿烂的阳光下，放肆奔跑的感觉。,I can't pull myself together in the raining day. I would enjoy the feeling of running under sunshine much more.
圆圆的满月看起来真美丽，可是弯弯的弦月也特别可爱！哎，好难选择啊！,"The full moon looks so beautiful, while the crescent moon looks so cute. Why I must make a choice!?"
哈提：我喜欢跟芬妮尔姐姐在一起，她给我一种很亲切的感觉。\n斯库尔：我就喜欢和熙玉妹妹一起玩耍，她也看着很亲切，而且看着还很美味（流口水）。\n哈提：……,Hati: I love spend time with Fenrir. I feel I can really relate to her.\nSköll: I love playing with Xiyu. She seems so nice and also... tasteful... (slobbering)
尼德霍格,Nidhogg

抑魔之鳞：提升所有上阵女神的魔抗。,Magi-repressed Scale: Increase the M.RES of all Line-up angels
尼德霍格是黑龙一族的女王，她们一族从古至今生活在世界树的树下，以世界树的根部和枝叶为食。但随着世界树的养分被不断吸食，这颗大树也面临着枯萎和倒塌的危险。为了救治世界树，保护族人赖以生存的依靠，尼德霍格穿越异世界，来到了幻兽之森。据说在这里，可以找到治好世界树的神药。,"Nidhogg is the queen of Black Dragon. They have lived under the World Tree since ancient times and feed on the root and branches of the World Tree. However, with the World Tree's nutrition consistently consumed, this giant tree is at the edge of withering and falling. \nTo save the World Tree and protect the only home they have, Nidhogg risked going to the otherworld and coming here, the Forest of Eudemons. It is said that the magic cure of the World Tree lay in the depth of the forest."
做为黑龙一族的女王，我一直是族人们的依靠！但从今以后，我也有了自己可以依靠的主人。,"As the queen of Black Dragon, I have always trusted by my people! However, from now on, I have a master that I can trust."
我不喜欢奥丁那个家伙，她总是固执地将世界树认定为是她的东西。,I don't like Odin. She is so stubborn and always believes that World Tree is her's.
人们总是认为黑龙一族是邪恶的种族，但那只是世人的偏见而已。,"People always thought Black Dragon is an evil creature, but it is just their prejudice."
我一定会找到救治世界树的神药，这是我向族人们所做出的承诺。,I must find the magic cure for the World Tree. It is the promise I made to our people.
耶梦加得,Jormungand
巨蛇,Serpen
刚毅之鳞,Firm Scale
刚毅之鳞：提升所有上阵女神的物抗。,Firm Scale: Increase P.RES of all line-up angels
相传，生活在无底深海中的尘世巨蟒一族，都是寄生于黑暗中的存在。但耶梦加得却不同，相比于黑暗，她却更向往光明。因此，在她成年之后，她便离开了深海，决心游历尘世，结交各族朋友，度过一个不一样的人生。,"It is said that the Midgard Serpent in the bottomless sea lives in the darkness and never leaves. However, it is not the case for Jormungand. Compared to darkness, her heart wants more of the bright side.\nAfter growing up, she is determined to live a much different life. So, she leaves the deep sea and travels all over Midgard, making friends with other races."
离开深海，来到尘世是我所做出的最正确的决心。因为，我在尘世间遇到了你——我最重要的主人！,"Leaving the deep sea and coming to the Midgard lands is the best choice I have ever made! Because of that, I met you here—my master, the most important person to me."
族人们总觉得我是个异类，但正因为我的特殊，我才能获得如此多的快乐。,My people always think I am a deviant. But how much fun they have lost just because of that conformity.
蛇其实是一种很温柔的动物！不信的话，你们可以问问我的主人。,We are actually a very gentle race! Don't believe me? Ask my master.
遇到我的主人之后，我才知道，人生原来可以这么的快乐。,I have found the melody of my life ever since I met my master.

我在做梦吗？这里是……,Am I dreaming? Where am I...
这里是梦境的深渊、欲望的迷宫，赫拉大人。,"My Lord Hera, this is the abyss of the dream, the maze of desire."
潘多拉？等等，这一切到底是怎么回事？！,Pandora? What is going on?
看来您朝思暮想的某个愿望，指引您打开了我的魔盒呢，嘻嘻……,"It seems one of your long-cherished wishes has led you to open my Box, hehe..."
啊……我好像感到所有的记忆都消失了一般。,Argh... Why I can't remember anything...
没错，魔盒在打开之时会取走您最珍贵的回忆，但也会赋予您新的力量。,"Indeed, the Box will take away your memory, the most precious thing one can have. But... it will also give you a new power."
新的力量？,New power?
力量的种子已经埋在了您的心里，激发您的战意，让它成长起来。,"Now you have the potential inside you. To grow it, you must fight."
因为在魔盒赋予的梦境里，战斗是引导您命运的唯一方式……,"Because in the dreamland created by the Box, the only way out is through battles."
你说的没错，潘多拉，我仿佛能感受到一种奇特力量的萌芽。,"You are right, Pandora. I do have the feeling that something is growing inside me."
一种强大，却很危险的力量……它会让您的神格突破到难以想象的程度。,A mighty but dangerous power... It will wake your godhood in a way that you can't imagine.
但梦境也会让您直面自己真实的欲望，如果控制不住这种欲望的话……,"Be careful. The dream will also force you to face your true desire, and once you lose control of yourself..."
会发生什么可怕的事情吗？,Something terrible will happen?
强大的力量和失控的欲望，会彻底让您迷失在梦境中，永远不会醒来。,The mighty power and uncontrollable desire will obsess you. You will be lost in the dreamland forever and never wake up.
我绝不会让这种事发生。,I will not let that happen.
您好像很有自信呢，但我从您的眼神中，也看到了一丝不安。,You seem so confident. But that anxious look can't get by me.
我会作为同伴，跟随您见证这梦境中的一切，尽可能地找到出口吧，嘻嘻……,"Anyway, I will be your accompany and witness your experiences here. I suggest you try your best to find the way out, hehe..."
我或许需要你的帮助……,I may need your help...
明智的决定……有我在的话，或许赫拉大人不会坠入黑暗的深渊吧，嘻嘻……,"Wise choice... I guess you will not fall into the dark abyss as I am by your side, hehe..."
梦境还很长，我期待您找到出口的那一刻……,There is still a long way to go. I am looking forward to seeing the day you find the exit...
赫拉，你为何会出现在梦境之地，这里可不是作为天后该来的地方。,"Hera, why are you here, the dreamland? This is not the place for the Queen of Olympus."
夜之女神倪克斯？我可没想到会在这种地方遇到你。,"Nyx, the goddess of the night? I didn't expect to meet you here."
幻境中所遇到的人，都与你的命运交错重叠，她们的出现并不奇怪。,"In the dreamland, you will meet those who have tangled with your fate. I am not surprised you met her here."
看来你和我一样，是对力量的渴望而迷失至此的。,"It seems you are lost out of the desire for power, just like me."
为了挽回末日降临以来失去的神力，我恐怕不能在这里输给你。,I am afraid we will have to fight to save all the power I lost after the doomsday.
倪克斯的神力已经丢失了大半，为什么还会有如此惊人的战斗力……,I remember Nyx has lost most of her power. Why does she still have such strong combat power...
在梦境里，大家初始的神格都是平等的，纯粹的力量是唯一的武器。,"In the dreamland, all of our godhood is equal. The pure source of power is from the weapon."
我为什么会在这里……赫拉？发生了什么事，我在做梦吗？,Why am I here... Hera? What happened? Am I dreaming?
夜之女神大人看来输给了欲望，成了梦境迷宫的牺牲者之一呐，嘻嘻……,"It seems the goddess of the night has lost to her desire and become the victim of the dreamland, hehe..."
哼……潘多拉，这想必这也是你的恶作剧所为吧？,"Humph, Pandora, that must be your doing!"
非常遗憾，并不是这样，只有碰过魔盒但欲望失控之人，才会徘徊于此。,"Unfortunately, it is not. One who touched the Box and lost to one's desire will end like that."
倪克斯女神，丢失的神力可以再度获得，但深陷于欲望的深渊，将永远迷失。,"Angel Nyx, the lost power can be regained, but the lost mind will be lost forever."
我们即使在过去有过冲突和争端，但眼下找到梦境出口才是最重要的，不是吗？,"Even if we have conflicts in the past, it is more important to find the way out, right?"
……你说的没错，我们尽快离开这里吧！,...You are right. Let's get the hell out of here!
站住！正义与审判的代行者将阻止你们继续前行！,Stop! The hand of justice and judge command you to stop there.
涅墨西斯？没有合适的理由就冒犯天后的权威，是一种无礼的行为！,Nemesis? It is rude to offend the Queen if you don't have any right cause.
自创世以来，诸神就一直因为各种私欲而犯下众多罪行。,"Ever since the creation, all gods have committed countless crimes out of their own desires."
就连你成为天后的路上，也留下了无数无辜者的悲叹……不是么？,Even your way to the queendom is built with the bodies of the innocents... Am I right?
我不否认指控，但只有力量能带来秩序！,I cannot deny it. But only power can bring order.
很好，如果你希望用力量来证明这一点，那么战斗将是唯一的选择！,"Fair enough. If you want to prove your point, we have no choice but to fight!"
权力的争斗中，没有人是无辜者！,No one is innocent in the struggle for power!
那么公平和正义也将不再宽恕你，让审判开始吧……,"Then, equity and justice will no longer stand by your side. Let the trial begin..."
好强大的力量……我可以感受到你内心的执着，你并非是一名纯粹的暴君……,Your power is so strong... I can sense the persistence in your mind. I guess you are not a tyrant at all...
我从不后悔当初自己所选择的道路，而我也不准备逃避责任！,"I never regret the way I step onto, and I am not afraid to take responsibility!"
哼……或许你的所作所为也是为了某种意义上的公正吧，这次我便不为难你了。,"Humph, I guess you're doing it for the good of justice. I will not make things difficult for you this time."
但是请你记住，如果有一天你抛弃了自己的信念和原则，审判会再度降临。,"But remember, if you betray your faith and principles one day, I will find you and bring my trial."
她消失了？进入梦境的人都不能自行离开才对，难道她……,She just disappears!? I thought no one could leave the dreamland of their own will... Is she...
您没发现吗？她并不是真实存在的，而只是您梦境中的一个幻影而已。,"Have you noticed? She is not real, but only a phantom in your dream."
之所以会梦到她，应该是您心中还存有对神权争斗中牺牲者的愧疚吧。,"The only reason you met here is that, in the deep of your mind, you still have the guilt for the innocents who died in the struggle for power."
……你说得没错，而这份愧疚如今已随着刚才的战斗消散了。,...I guess you are right. I feel this guilt has gone after the battle.
梦境会帮助您消除心中的犹豫，新的力量也正是诞生于此。,"The dreamland helps you to dispel the anxiety in your mind. After that, power can be born."
我感到身体里的那份力量已经开始成长了。,I feel the power inside me has begun to grow.
但伴随这份力量而来的，却是一种不安，仿佛自己的欲望正在吞噬灵魂一般……,"However, there is also another anxious feeling that follows. I feel my desire is devouring my soul..."
很久没见了，赫拉，没想到会在这里遇到你。,"It has been a long time, Hera. I didn't expect to meet you here."
大地之母盖亚吗……我还清晰地记得您沉睡前的那一刻。,"Gaia, the goddess of the Earth... I remember the moment vividly before you fall asleep."
我沉睡了如此之久，也算等来了唤醒我的人。,I have been asleep for so long and finally have someone to wake me up.
您知道如何离开这个梦境吗？,Do you know how to leave the dreamland?
触碰潘多拉魔盒的人，必然有强烈的渴求，或者说……未达成的心愿。,The one who touches the Box must have some strong desires or...unfulfilled wishes.
而这份心愿达成之时，就能找到梦境的出口。,"Once you have fulfilled them, you can find the exit of the dreamland."
那么，我们应该要怎么办？,"So, what are we gonna do now?"
让我在战斗中窥探一下你内心深处的渴望吧，这或许会为你指明道路。,Let me take a look at your inner desire. Maybe it will be helpful.
一场不错的战斗，虽然只在刹那间，但我窥见了你内心深处的世界。,"It is a good fight. Although it was just a spur of one moment, I saw the inner world of your mind."
作为天后，你渴望所有人的尊敬，但事情并不能如你所愿。,"As a queen, you desire the respect of everyone. However, it does not always go your way."
而你的身份却让你无法接受这个现实，最终开始渴望权力，寻求力量，没错吧？,Your place makes you incapable of accepting the truth. So you become power-hungry and turn to seek more power. Am I right?
我承认，的确如此……,"Yes, you are right..."
你已经开始放下心中那个高傲的自己了，说实话，比我想象中要快。,"So you have already let go of that condescending self. To be honest, it is much quicker than I thought."
如果高傲的心会阻碍我的前进，我并不介意抛弃这份负担。,I will reduce any burden if that stands in my way.
你终究没有让我失望，就让我与你共同面对之后的麻烦吧。,I guess you didn't fail me at all. Let me stand by you and face all troubles ahead together.
不，并不是这样！,"No, I am not like that!"
嗯……真的吗？平息你内心的高傲，才能看到真实的自己。,Hmm... Is that true? Let go of that condescending self so you can see the true self.
你还没有我想象中那么成熟，在这场梦境结束前，就让我照顾好你的安全吧。,"You are not mature enough to take care of this. Before this ends, let me take care of you."
赫拉，你也是来阻止我的吗？看来我们两个人的战斗还没有结束！,"Hera, are you going to stop me? I guess the thing between us is not over yet."
雅典娜？！等等！我和你之间的争端已随特洛伊战争的落幕而平息了。,Athena?! Wait! Our conflict is resolved as the Trojan War has ended.
很遗憾，在我看来事实并不是这样，你会出现在这梦境中就是证明。,"Unfortunately, it is not true as we are both in the dreamland."
我们都曾为争夺金苹果而付出了太多牺牲，真的有必要这样吗？,We have paid so much to compete for the Golden Apple. It is not necessary to resort to violence.
这些话没有意义，我们之间必须决出最终的胜者！,Your words mean nothing to me. There can be only one winner between us!
够了，雅典娜！一切都结束了，我们的分歧只会给希腊神系带来更多灾难！,"Enough, Athena! It is all ended. Our conflicts can only bring more disasters to the Greek gods!"
还没有……只要我还没有倒下……,It is not enough... as long as I am alive...
身为战争女神，你应该明白你我力量的差距！,"As the goddess of war, you should know that we are mismatched!"
……你说的没错，战争的胜负永远以力量来决定，而你的力量确实在我之上。,...You are right. The outcome of a war is always determined by power. And you are indeed more powerful than me.
你作为这场争斗最后的胜利者，理应得到我的尊敬和追随。,"As the winner of this battle, you deserve my respect, and I will follow your lead."
那将是我的荣幸，请相信我会善用你的力量。,It is my honor too. Believe me. I will make good use of your power.
身为智慧女神，你应该明白和平才是终点。,"As the goddess of wisdom, you should know that peace matters most."
……你说的没错，换不来和平与团结的战争，不会有真正的赢家。,"...You are right. The outcome of the war has to be peace and unity. If that is not the case, there will be no winner."
你我最终的目的都是离开这里，或许同盟会是更明智的选择。,We share the same goal of leaving here. Maybe allying with you will be a wise choice.
如你所言，我的枪将为你迎敌。,"As you say, I will fight for you."
别来无恙，亲爱的，我早该料到会面对你这个让我头疼的家伙。,"How have you been, my dear? I should have known that I gonna meet you here."
宙斯？你会出现在这里，意味着你也有心愿未了吧？,"Zeus? Since you are here, I guess you also have unfinished wishes."
猜对了，不过幸运女神看来没怎么眷顾你，让你在梦境中徘徊到现在还没出去。,"You are right! But it seems Lady Luck hasn't been on your side, as you are still trapped here."
哼……,Humph...
我并不意外，亲爱的，不用猜也知道你所渴求的是什么。,"I am not surprised, my love. I know exactly what you want."
你希望得到其他神明的尊敬，尤其是作为众神之王的我的尊敬，不是吗？,"You want to be respected by other gods, especially me, the King of Gods. Am I right?"
我不会否认你的话，神权只有一个顶点，只有战斗能解决这个问题。,I would not deny it. There can be only one who has the strongest divine power. Let's settle it with power.
你比以前强了很多呢，亲爱的，会输给你真让我意外。,"You are much stronger than before, my dear. I am surprised to lose to you."
神权之争落下帷幕了，看来我终究是最后的胜利者。,"The war of divine power has ended, and I am the winner."
我更好奇的是你会如何运用神权带来的强大力量。,I wonder how you gonna use the Wonder power it brings.
重新树立希腊众神的秩序。,To rebuild the order of the Greek Gods.
如果是以前，我认为你这么做只会给所有人带来麻烦……,"If it is in the old days, I would believe that you are causing trouble to everyone..."
但现在把神权交给你，或许也不是坏事，希腊众神会期待你所创造的新秩序。,"However, I am not worried about handing it to you now. Greek Gods will look forward to the new order you built."
征服其他所有神系。,Conquer all other gods.
呵呵……有趣的想法，我以为只有自己才会具备这样的野心。,"Hehe, interesting thoughts. I guess I am not the only one capable of having such ambitions."
我会一直跟随你，并为你见证这一切的。,I will follow you till the end.
赫拉，虽然宙斯已经将神权交付于你，但并不意味着我和哈迪斯也认可此行为。,"Hera, although Zeus has given you divine power, it doesn't mean that Hades and I approve of that."
我会用实力证明这是一个正确的决定。,I will prove myself with my power.
希腊众神需要一个新秩序，波塞冬，不觉得这是一次机会吗？,"The Greek God really need a new order, Poseidon. Don't you think it is a great opportunity?"
说实话，我早已厌倦了那些多余的争端，以这次战斗来做个了结，我也不反对。,"To be honest, I am tired of all these conflicts long ago. It might be good to end this with a fight."
不得不说，如今的你或许确实具备了统领希腊众神的能力。,I have to say you've been competent in leading Greek gods.
统领众神是一个漫长的过程，但我不会容许自己失败。,"It's a long process, but I won't allow myself to fail."
我选择交出掌管大海的神权，希望你能够好好使用这份力量。,"I will hand over the ocean theocracy, and I hope you can utilize this power properly."
至于选择和你们争来争去打个没完，我更有兴趣选择和这个世界的人类去冲浪。,"Instead of fighting against you, I'd prefer to surf with mortals."
哈迪斯，希腊神系需要面对新的命运，我需要你的力量来改变这一切。,"Hades, the Greek gods, are facing a new fate. I need your power to help me change everything."
……我倒是有点兴趣，但我从来不会和弱者合作，让我见识一下你的力量吧。,"... I'm sort of got interested in it. But I never cooperate with the weak. Show me your power, and I will then decide."
还真是符合你的原则，哈迪斯。,"It's really in line with your principle, Hades."
如果新的神权秩序有助于冥界的势力，我并没有反对的必要。,I will not object if the new theocratic establishment can bring significant benefits to Underworld.
哼……你会见识到的，那么让我们开始吧。,Humph... You'll see it! I'm ready.
呵呵……看来命运确实站在了你这一边呐。,Huh... It seems that destiny stands by your side for this time.
兑现你的承诺吧，我向你保证，冥界在我的统治下，不会让你失望的。,Make good on your promise. And I assure you I won't let you down.
我拭目以待……,I will wait and see...
欢迎来到欲望和权力的深渊，赫拉。,"Welcome to the abyss of desire and power, Hera."
创世神卡俄斯？看来连你也彻底迷失在梦境中了……,"The creator, Chaos? It seems you're also lost in the dreamland."
你错了，赫拉，作为秩序与混沌的双重化身，欲望和权力都无法束缚住我。,"Not really, Hera. As the embodiment of order and chaos, neither desire nor power can bind me."
反倒是你的处境更有意思呢，现在你已经具备了足以与我抗衡的强大力量……,"Instead, your situation is more interesting because you've owned the power to fight against me."
我开始明白为什么会在梦境中见到你了……我只是渴望获得最强者的认同而已。,Now I see why I met you in the dreamland... I just want to be acknowledged by the most powerful one.
如果不击败你，我恐怕永远无法离开这场梦。,I can't leave here unless I defeat you.
呵呵……有趣，那么就让我陪你们玩玩吧……,"Huh... Interesting. Well, let me show you my power."
好强……这就是创世神的力量吗？但胜负已定，最终的胜利依旧是属于我的……,Incredible... The creator's power is indeed strong. But it is all over. The final victory belongs to mine.
赫拉，凭你现在的力量能胜过我，我并不感到意外。,"Hera, I'm not surprised that you can defeat me with your current power."
你这是什么意思？你想说这一切都在预料之中？,What do you mean? You have expected it?
按照创世律法，你可以夺走我作为创世神的神权。,"According to the Genesis Order, you can take away my divine power."
这神权强大无比，一旦取得，整个希腊将没有任何存在会是你的对手。,"This divine power is mighty. Once acquired, no one in Greece will be your opponent."
但这强大的力量是你神格无法掌控的，你迟早会失去灵魂，沦为它的傀儡。,But it's not easy to control it with your current godhood. You will lose your soul and become its puppet.
这不可能……,No way...
信不信由你，做出不会让你后悔的选择吧，天后赫拉。,"Believe it or not, make a decision you'll not regret, my Queen Hera."
力量就是一切！,Power is everything!
呵呵……和我所想的一样，强大无比的力量依旧是欲望的终点……,Huh... I've already known that incomparable power is still the end of desire.
我有掌控这份力量的决心和信念，卡俄斯，请不用为我担心。,"Don't worry, Chaos. I have the determination and faith to control this divine power."
希望如此吧，愿决心和信念引导你将来的命运。,I hope so. May your determination and faith guide your future destiny.
我绝不会为了力量抛弃灵魂！,I never give up my soul for power.
这么多次在梦境中轮回，你终于找到了迷宫的出口……,"After countless circles in the dreamland, you finally find your way out of the maze."
但在你醒来之前，还需要越过最后的一个阻碍。,"But before you wake up, you need to overcome the last obstacle."
最后一个阻碍？,The last obstacle?
呵呵……你很快就会遇到她的，那个徘徊于此梦境迷宫中的噩梦之源……,Huh... You'll meet her soon. The evil spirit who create their place...
终于见面了呢，另一个我……,"We finally met, another me."
天哪……是我眼花了吗？！你究竟是谁？！,Jesus... I can't believe my eyes! Who on earth are you?!
在她的身上我感受到了卡俄斯的创世神力，我有不好的预感……,I can feel the divine power of Chaos in her body. I have a bad feeling about this...
作为智慧女神的我竟然看不穿她的真名！,"As the goddess of wisdom, I can't even see through her mind."
神明的复制体吗……？不，它是徘徊于梦境的无魂梦魇。,"Is it a duplicate? No, it's an evil spirit wandering in the dreamland."
呵呵……拒绝压倒一切的力量与权力，你终究只会沦为徒有天后之名的弱者罢了。,"Huh... Suppose you are unwilling to accept the power that can overwhelm everything. In that case, you'll eventually become the weak who only owns a deceptive reputation of Queen."
众神依旧会看不起你，宙斯也终将离你而去，迎接你的永远是失落与悲哀。,The gods will still look down upon you. Zeus will eventually leave you. All you have will be disappointment and depression.
身为冒牌货，废话可真是不少，亲爱的，别和它浪费时间了。,"Imposter, you're talking absolute nonsense. My dear, don't waste your time with her."
以天后赫拉之名！全军突击！,"In the name of Queen, Hera! At my signal, attack!"
赫……拉……你这个胆小鬼……不要以为这就是结束……,Hera... You coward... This is not the end...
只要你心中……还有自负……嫉妒……我迟早会取代你的神格……给我记住……,"As long as you hide conceit... and jealousy... in your mind, I will take your place one day... Remember it..."
终于消失了吗，真是个难缠的家伙。,Is it finally gone? What a hot potato!
赫拉大人，您还因为刚才的战斗而感到畏惧吗？,"Lord Hera, are you still concerned about the battle?"
如果我还是过去那个孤独的自己，或许在战斗前我就会放弃抵抗吧。,"If I were as lonely as the self I used to be, I would have given up before the battle."
但如今我与你们牢固的羁绊，早已驱散了心中嫉妒和自负的阴影。,"But now, I've formed a strong bond with you all, which has dispelled the shadows brought by my conceit and jealousy."
所以，即使我不是最勇猛的战士，但我绝无理由向这种没有灵魂的傀儡低头。,"So, even though I'm not the most intrepid warrior, there's no reason for me to submit to a soulless puppet."
亲爱的，这场梦境让你成长了不少，不是吗？,"Dear, this dreamland experience really helped you to grow up."
如你所言，我会永远记住这场梦的，走吧，梦境的出口已经在眼前了。,"As you said, I'll never forget it. Let's go. The exit is close."

阿波罗，你的到来会为诸神阵营提供更强大的战力，但在此之前，你必须经过众神的历练！,"Apollo, your coming brings greater power to all gods. However, you must go through our trial first!"
我察觉到了，在你体内蕴含着强大的光之力量！这股力量一旦觉醒，必能照耀世间的一切黑暗！,"I sense that mighty light power inside you. I bet once it is awakened, all darkness will be dispelled!"
驱逐邪恶和黑暗是我的使命，不管是在原来的那个世界，还是现在的这个世界，我都义不容辞！,"My duty is to drive out all evils. No matter where I am, I will fulfill it with my whole heart."
传说中的光明之神终于来了！我等你很久了，跟我来一场光与火的较量吧！,"You must be the famous god of light! I have been waiting for you for so long. Let's see whose power is stronger, your light or my fire?"
我也是第一次见到如此强大的火之力量，期待与你的战斗！,I have never seen such powerful strength of fire. I am looking forward to our battle.
想要在这个世界随心所欲的使用神力，必须要经过特殊的训练！就让我的弓箭来指引你找到新的方向吧！,"If you want to use your power at your own will, special training is what you need now. Let my arrow guides you to the new way out!"
有你的指引，我相信自己很快就能觉醒新的力量。,"With your guidance, I believe a new power will be awakened soon!"
阿波罗，你作为希腊神话阵营中，唯一的光明之神，我对你抱有极高的期望！希望你的光芒照射到这个世界的每一个角落！,"Apollo, as the only god of light on the Greek side, I have high hopes for you! Hope your glows will reach every corner of the world."
我会为这个世界，带来更光明的未来的！在此之前，我将接受您的考验。,"I will bring a brighter future to this world! And before that, I will accept your challenge."
我是拉，埃及神话中的太阳之神！就让我代表这个世界的太阳，对你进行最终的考验吧！,"I am Ra, the god of the sun in Egyptian. Let me represent the sun of this world and start this trial for you."
为了这一刻，我早已准备多时，我一定会获得所有太阳神的认可！,I have been waiting for this moment to come for so long. I am ready to get approval from all sun gods.

啊啦？这里是梦境深渊吗？看来又有淘气的家伙在恶作剧呐。,"Alas, is this the dreamland abyss? Looks like someone has been naughty."
出来吧潘多拉，这梦境是你造的吧？你可以瞒得过其他神，不过别想瞒得过我。,"Come on, Pandora. This is your realm, right? Other gods may have believed your little trick, but not me."
不愧是创世神的洞察力，但遗憾的是您只猜对了一半。,"You truly have a great perception as a Creator, Lord Chaos. But unfortunately, you are only half right."
那么不妨告诉我没猜对的另一半是什么，小猫咪？,So why don't you tell me what the other half is? My little kitty.
另一半嘛，就是并非我引导您至此，而是当您有愿望想实现时，梦境才会打开。,The other half is that I am not the one who lead you here. This dreamland will only open to those who have strong desires.
有意思，不过遗憾的是，我没察觉到自己有什么愿望需要实现。,Interesting. But I don't sense any desire of mine.
嘻嘻，欲求是不会写在脸上的呢，不妨自己猜猜看呐，创世神大人。,"Hehe, obviously, the desire cannot reveal itself. Why don't you ask yourself what you want most in the world? My dear Creator."
嗯……这么说来，眼下好像确实有件可以让我找找乐子的事情呢，呵呵……,"Well... However, I do think there is one thing I would desire to do, hehe..."
哎？您为什么一直盯着我，等等……等下！您要做什么？！,"Geez, why do you stare at me like that? Wait... What're you doing!?"
你瞧，通往别处的门不是开了吗？看来好好疼爱你一番是正确的选择呢！,"Look, the door to other places has opened. It seems that to have fun with you is a good choice~"
我……我认输了，快停手……,I... I yield! Please stop...
老实交代吧，小猫咪，到底是怎么回事？,"To be honest with me, little kitty, what is going on?"
呜……如果您不是主动进入梦境的话，就只可能是其他人召唤您了。,"Waah... If you do not come here by your own will, then maybe others have summoned you here."
嗯？那么你知道这个人是谁吗？,Well... Do you know who it is?
我也不知道，但梦境是靠意念相连的，如果召唤您的人意志非常坚定，彼此迟早会相遇。,"I don't know. However, the dreamland is connected by will. If the one who summoned you has a strong will, you will meet him or her sooner or later."
啊啦……我的魅力有这么大吗？看来有必要抓你一块去见见这个家伙呢，我们走吧。,Alas... I don't know that I have such charm. Looks like we have to meet this guy together. Let's hit the road!
我对这些没什么兴趣，带我离开这里就行。,I don't care about all these. Just take me out of here.
真是意外，好奇心一向很重的卡俄斯竟然没兴趣，难道是创世神独有的第六感……,"What a surprise. Chaos, the embodiment of curiosity, doesn't care about it? Is that the sixth sense of the Creator has worked?"
嗯？你说什么？,What? What are you saying?
没……没什么！我说我们最好尽快离开这里！,No...Nothing! I said we'd better go as soon as possible!
卡俄斯大人？好吧，看来您也被困在梦境里了。,"Lord Chaos? Well, it seems you have been trapped here too."
嗯……？光明圣徒伊卡璐斯？我感觉你不像是会召唤我这位秩序与混沌之神的家伙。,"Hmm? You are Icarus, the saint of light. I don't think you are the one who summoned me."
如您所言，我并没有召唤您的到来，但我一直在寻求离开这个梦境的方法。,"Just as you said, it is not me. And I am also finding my way out."
原来是这样，你有什么发现吗？,I see. Did you find anything?
战斗似乎是这里唯一的法则，你总会遇到希望较量的对手，或是曾经恐惧的敌人。,It seems the only rule here is to battle. You are gonna battle with a serious rival or enemies that you once feared.
呵呵……我明白你的意思了。,... I see your point.
坦然地说，您确实是我想挑战的人之一，来吧。,"To be honest, I have dreamed of the day competing with you. Come on, fight me."
看来创世神的力量，比我想象中更加深不可测。,That is the power of the Creator... More unfathomable than I imagine...
并非如此，进入梦境后我感到大部分力量都消失了，但每次击败对手，就会恢复一部分。,"I don't think I have fully used my power since most of it seems lost when I enter here. However, I can sense its recovery after defeating the enemy."
也就是说，其实整个梦境……是一场试炼？,"So, is that mean this whole dream is actually... a trial?"
我目前没有证据可以证明，不过继续前进的话，应该会有答案。,We don't know that for sure. Maybe the answer will reveal itself if we continue our journey.
但愿如此，我们尽快前进吧，通往下一层梦境的传送门已经打开了。,I hope so. Let's go. The portal to the next level is open.
赫拉？等等……好像有些不对劲！我可以感觉到她身上弥漫着强大但扭曲的力量。,Hera? Wait... Something is wrong. I can sense the mighty but somehow twisted power within her body...
啊啦……看来我们的天后大人在这个梦境里遇到了些麻烦。,Alas... It seems our queen has encountered some troubles here.
这是被梦境的深渊之力侵袭所造成的，唔……硬拼的话，我们有把握能取胜吗？,I guess the power of the abyss has something to do with that... Do you think we stand a chance if we throw caution to the wind?
这我可不知道，但最好的方式就是亲自试试看！,"I have no idea. But, at least we can try!"
总算是解决了，拥有深渊之力的上位神明真是难对付！,Finally... I guess that's the power of a high-level god with the blessing of the abyss.
看来有不少被这种力量侵蚀后产生的幻影，在梦境里游荡，最好小心一些。,We'd better be careful. Looks like there are more of these phantoms influenced by the power of the abyss.
无论如何，我都不会认同由你们继承希腊的最高神权。,I will never agree to let you take the supreme divine power of greek.
然而希腊的统治权只归于强者，就算再来一次神界战争，我也没什么可畏惧的。,It is not up to you. Only the survivor of the battle can decide. I don't mind having another war to see who is the strongest.
虽然我对于权力这种东西已经没什么兴趣了，但我很乐意重新和你较量较量，宙斯……,"Although I am not interested in the struggle for power, I don't mind having a contest with you, Zeus..."
看来希腊神系几千年来没什么改变呐，我以为众神的争端迟早会结束的。,"Thousands of years have passed. And you Greek gods are still the same, always fighting for power."
卡俄斯？最高神权由强者所掌控，这是上古时期的法则，没有修改和否认的余地。,Chaos? Only the strongest can handle the supreme divine power. There is no room to change this ancient rule.
啊啦……别误会，这项法则由我所定，我可没有否认它的意思。,Ah... Don't get me wrong. I am the one who made this rule. I would not deny it.
您不会是要……,"Then, I suppose you want to..."
猜对了呢，这么久都没有决出一位真正的强者，看来我要亲自给你们上一课了，呵呵……,"You are right. What took you so long to decide who is the strongest? I should give you all a lesson now, hehe..."
这就是创世神的力量吗……这种程度即使是宙斯恐怕也无法对抗……,That's the strength of the Creator... I guess even Zeus cannot compete with her...
真是遗憾……看来后辈们没有我想象中那么强。,What a pity... It seems you are not as strong as I thought.
唉，或许命运还没有允许我成为希腊神系的掌控者。,"Alas, maybe fate has not granted me to become the master of Greek gods..."
然而和你的战斗依旧让我挺兴奋，我好像明白一直以来自己期待的是什么了……,"However, I enjoy the fight with you. Maybe that's what I have been waiting for..."
另外，如果你不介意的话，和我一起离开这个梦境，再考虑挑战宙斯她们如何？,"Also, if you don't mind, what about joining my team? You can think about rechallenging Zeus after we get out."
我也这么想，毕竟很难找到更好的选择了。,"I think so. I don't have any better options, right?"
卡俄斯，混沌与秩序的创造者，呵呵……我对于你出现在梦境深渊并不感到意外。,"Chaos, the Creator of chaos and order... I am not surprised to see you here."
令人惊讶，你的能力在梦境中变强了很多，去和宙斯争夺最高神权，也并非没有机会。,It is surprising to see you become more powerful in this dreamland. I think now you can stand a chance to fight with Zeus.
最高神权曾是我最渴望得到的东西，但现在只不过是无聊的虚荣而已。,"I have once dreamed of that, to compete for the supreme divine power. However, it now all feels like empty vanity to me."
啊啦……这话可真够意外，我很好奇什么玩意能让嗜权如命的冥王如此着迷。,"Ah... I am surprised to hear that. I wonder what has changed your mind, the once power-lusting King of Death."
如果想知道这个秘密的话，就用实力让我开口吧，呵呵。,"If you want to know, you need to beat me first, hehe."
看来即使梦境深渊封印了创世之力，在战斗经验上我依旧不是你的对手……,"Why... Your genesis power is already sealed by this place, but I still can't defeat you..."
那么亲爱的，可以告诉我你的秘密了吗？,"So my darling, can you tell me your secret now?"
这个秘密……和潘多拉魔盒的梦境深渊有关，我听说你是被召唤至此的？,This secret... is related to Pandora's box. I heard that someone summoned you here.
据潘多拉的话而言是这样，我本来还挺期待能从召唤我的人手里，收到一张漂亮的邀请函。,Pandora has said it too. I thought I would receive a fancy invitation letter from him or her.
如果你感兴趣的话告诉你也无妨，召唤者……听说是个人类。,"If you are interested, I heard that the summoner is... a human being."
喔，是吗？但是我印象里的哈迪斯，可不会这么大方地给我如此重要的消息。,"Oh, is that so? I don't remember you being so kind as to give me such important intel."
因为我也很想知道她召唤你的原因，和某个梦境深渊的法则，呵呵……,Because I am also interested in knowing why she summoned you and how this place works.
如果想知道的话，不如和我一块去问问她怎么样？,"If you want to know, why don't you join me and we can ask her together?"
不错的提议……,Good advice...
我还在想为什么波塞冬和哈迪斯没有追上来，原来她们已经被击败了。,I was wondering why Poseidon and Hades didn't catch up with me. Now I see that they were all defeated and joined you.
啊啦……感到压力了吗，亲爱的？,"Ah... My dear, does that make you anxious?"
你在开玩笑？即使是面对创世神，我也不会有任何畏惧，我必须要证明自己的实力。,"Are you kidding? I will not have any fear even facing you, the mighty Creator."
你的气势我挺中意的，如果能击败我，那么获得波塞冬和哈迪斯的认同，也并不是难事。,"I appreciate your courage. If you defeat me, I guess they will recognize your position as always."
那么没有必要多说什么了，来吧！,Then we have nothing more to say. Come on!
呵呵……我秩序与混沌的掌控者卡俄斯，将亲自测试你的能力。,"Hehe, I, Chaos, the master of order and chaos, will test your ability myself."
看来我远远低估了创世神的力量。,I guess... I have underestimated your power...
一场让人兴奋的较量不是吗，我感到越和强大的对手战斗，力量回归得也越快……,"What an exciting contest, isn't it? I feel that the stronger my opponent is, the quicker my strength will recover..."
在梦境深渊内，所有人原本的力量都会失去，不断挑战强大的对手，这些力量才能回归。,"In this dreamland, all original power will be lost. Only by challenging more and more powerful foes can those power be recovered."
而这份力量，据说最终将帮你实现内心中的愿望。,"And that, it is said that this power can make your wish come true."
原来如此……但遗憾的是，我依旧还是没察觉有什么真正想要的东西。,"Well... Unfortunately, I still don't know what I want."
这可不好说，没准穿过下一扇梦境之门时，你就会看到答案了。,It's too early to say that. Maybe you can find the answer through the door to the next dreamland.
啊啦……好吧，在这一连串让人疲倦的战斗之后，我希望答案是个豪华而舒适的浴缸……,"Ah... Well, I hope the answer will be a luxury and comfortable bathtub..."
哟，创世神卡俄斯……看看你身后众神的阵势可真够吓人的，这是打算毁灭世界？,"Yo, isn't this the Creator, Chaos? Look at all those goddesses behind you. Are you preparing to destroy the world?"
别开玩笑了，距离上次见面已经过去了几万年，我可没想到在梦境还有机会遇见你。,"Stop kidding, Erebus. It has been tens of thousands of years... I wasn't expecting to meet you here."
不过你的出现，也意味着召唤咒文成功了，哼……,"Seeing you here, I guess the summoning has succeeded..."
说到召唤咒文，你好像知道些内情嘛，亲爱的，召唤创世神的代价可是很大的。,"Speaking of the summoning, it seems you know something about it. You know the price to summon the Creator, right?"
的确是这样，然而告诉你内情之前，不该和老朋友先打个招呼、叙叙旧吗？呵呵……,"Indeed. But as an old friend, don't you think we should first warm up a little?"
啊啦……几万年没亲热，觉得寂寞了？那就让我好好疼爱疼爱你再说吧。,"Someone feels lonely when I am not around, huh? Then, let me give you some entertainment..."
哎？这就吃不消了？我还打算玩点更刺激的呐。,"Ahh, is that too much for you? I am gonna bring something more exciting... hehe..."
不打了……你的战斗方式和以前一样那么暴力……,"Stop, stop... You just won't get out of your fighting way, so violent!"
那么回到正题，我被召唤的原因究竟是什么？,"So, let's get back to the point. Why was I summoned?"
潘多拉魔盒内的梦境，只要怀有强大执念就能够进入这里，这你已经知道了。,"If you have an intense obsession, then you can enter this dreamland in Pandora's box, right?"
不久前我听说一个人类进入了梦境，而这个家伙的身份，我相信你并不陌生。,"Not long ago, I heard a human being had entered here. And I am sure you know her well..."
让我印象深刻的人类只有一个，难道……,A human being I knew... You mean...
呵呵……她在现实世界中，并不至于强大到让我们神明感到压力。,"Hehe... Although she is not that powerful in the real world,"
但在这里，她已经强到让众神无奈的地步了，我们都很惊讶人类竟然有如此恐怖的潜能。,"but in here, she is now more powerful than any gods... We are surprised to see that potential lives in a human being."
还真是个麻烦的家伙，她在哪？,What a problem... Where is she?
别急，再穿过两扇梦境之门，你就会见到她了，我们出发吧。,Calm down. You will meet her in no time. Let's go.
您总算来了，创世神，我们等您很久了。,"Finally, you came, the Creator. We have been waiting for you for so long."
倪克丝？你为什么会出现在梦境里？你也有希望实现的愿望吗？,Nyx? Why are you here? What wish could you have?
我、厄瑞玻斯和盖亚三大原始神有着共同的愿望，就是寻回原本失去的神力。,"Erebus, Gaia, and I, the three origin gods, all have the same wish: to find our lost divine power."
然而糟糕的是，我们遇到了不小的麻烦，不得不暂时放弃。,But we then get into troubles...
啊啦……麻烦的原因，和那个人类有关吧？,"Alas... the trouble, I guess, has something to do with that human being, right?"
是啊，那个天真但可怕的家伙守在梦境深渊的最后一道门前，所有人都出不去了。,Yes. That innocent but terrible being guards the final door of this dreamland so that no one can get out of here.
有意思，我有兴趣好好和她较量一番了。,Interesting. I cannot wait to fight with her.
梦境深渊的法则是力量的争夺，战胜我的话，我的力量也会融入您的灵魂，助您一臂之力。,The rule of the dreamland is all about the fight over power. My power will become part of your strength if you have defeated me. That might be helpful.
相对地，如果我彻底认输的话，你也将获得我的力量，没错吧？,"Also, if you beat me, you would acquire my power. Am I right?"
呵呵……从古至今，我可从没见过您向谁认输过，不是吗？,"Hehe... But I haven't seen you yield to anyone, right?"
如何，倪克丝？即使暂时失去创世之力，我的战斗也没让你失望吧？,"How about this, Nyx? Even if I lost my genesis power, this kind of battle didn't let you down, right?"
在获得我的力量后，您应该能和那个人类一较高下了。,I think you may stand a chance to beat that human being after getting my power.
我欠你个人情，如果不介意的话，离开梦境后我会好好请你喝一杯。,I owe you one. I will buy you a drink after all this if you don't mind.
许久没见了，秩序与混沌之主，卡俄斯。,"Long time no see Chaos, the Lord of order and chaos."
盖亚，你败给那个人类我挺惊讶的，身为原始神，你的力量几乎与我不相上下。,"Gaia, I am surprised a human defeated you since you and I all share comparable power as the origin god."
我们原本的力量在这个梦境里没有多少意义，战斗意志和执念才是最重要的力量来源。,Our original strength means nothing here. The will and obsession in the battle is the primary source of the power.
虽然您自认为没有想实现的愿望，但我感受到了您享受战斗的喜悦。,"Although you think you don't have any wish, I do sense your bliss for continuous battles."
啊啦……你猜的没错，我并不否认这一点。,Alas... I guess you are right.
身为创世神，在现实世界中无敌于天下的您，或许最大的愿望就是挑战更强的对手。,"As a Creator, you are more powerful than anyone in the real world. Maybe your biggest wish is to find one opponent that is stronger than you."
而这也是我与那个人类产生的召唤咒文产生共鸣，来到这个梦境的原因吧？,And that is why I find resonance with that summon spell cast by that human...
您终于意识到了，而那个人类的愿望，也正是“挑战众神中最强的存在”。,Indeed. And her wish is precisely the opposite of yours: to challenge the most powerful god.
呵……这也是一种宿命，不是吗？既然如此，就让这场派对更热闹些吧！,"Heh... I guess it is meant to be like that. In that case, why don't we bring more fun to this party?"
看来没有再战斗下去的必要了，您的战斗力已经远远在我之上，我认输。,I think there is no need to continue our battle. I surrender. Your power is way stronger than mine.
在获得你的力量后，我感到创世之力已经回到了自己的灵魂中，而且……比以前还要强大。,"After getting your strength, I sense that genesis power is returning to me. And... it is more powerful than any time."
没错，以您现在的力量甚至足以改变梦境深渊的规则，直接带领我们从这里离开。,"That's right. Now, your power is so strong that you can even change the rule of this place, which means you can take us away right now."
这确实是一个稳妥的方式，但这样做会有什么后果吗？,"This is a quick fix, but what is the consequence?"
一旦改变规则，那个人类将因为愿望无法实现，而独自一人在梦境中徘徊，直至永远。,"Once the rule has changed, that human will be alone in this dreamland, wandering forever because her wish can not come true."
对于她来说，这未免太残酷了……,It seems so cruel to let her be trapped here.
但如果您选择满足她的愿望，接受挑战的话，一旦失败，创世之力也将会被她夺走。,"But if you choose to fulfill her wish and accept the challenge, there is a chance you will lose everything, including your genesis power."
这意味着我将失去一切，是吗……？以刚才和你的战斗来看，盖亚，你认为我有几分胜算？,"Lose everything... Gaia, based on our battle, what are the chances if I am against her?"
她很强，强到让众神畏惧的程度，如果说我认为胜算仅有50%，您会作何选择呢？,"She is strong, strong enough to frighten most of the gods. If I say it is fifty-fifty, what would you choose?"
我依旧会享受这场最后的战斗。,I will still enjoy this last battle.
您依旧和以前一样从不服输呢，希腊众神将共同见证这场战斗，愿您武运昌隆……,"Hmm, you are still the same, so competitive. All Greek gods will witness this battle together. Wish you good luck."
为了希腊神系的未来，我不应冒这个险。,I will not take chances on the future of the Greek gods.
希腊神系的未来确实无比重要，但我也为那个人类感到惋惜。,The future of the Greek gods is indeed important. But that poor thing...
这份永恒的孤独，也是她需要面对的命运，就如同我创世前那漫长的混沌时代。,"This ultimate loneliness is the fate she needs to face, just like me in the chaos time before I create the world."
愿命运引导她的灵魂，梦境出口已经打开，事不宜迟，我们离开这里吧。,Wish that fate could lead her soul. The exit of the dreamland is open. Let's get out of this place.
你终于来了，我等待这一刻已经很久了……,You finally came. I have been waiting for this moment for so long...
啊啦……果然是你呢，不得不说，你现在的这身打扮，比学生装要帅气多了。,Alas... I thought it would be you. I have to say you look more charming in that suit.
哼哼，如果你认为我有所改变的只是外貌，接下来恐怕就得吃苦头了。,"Hmmm... If you think the only thing that has changed is my appearance, maybe you gotta pay for that later."
是吗，亲爱的？我一直不觉得自己有理由输给你……等等！这难道是……！,"Is that so, my dear? I don't think I have a reason to lose to you... Wait! Is that..."
你能感受到吧？我灵魂中那与你极为相似的力量……,"You can feel it, right? The similar power in my soul..."
创世之力？！不可能！没有神明血统的你，怎么可能继承这种力量？！,The genesis power!? It is impossible! You don't even have the blood of a god. Why can you have such power in your soul?
不要小看人类的可能性，希腊的创世神卡俄斯，准备好迎接派对最后的高潮了吗？,"Never underestimate a human being, the origin god of Greek, Chaos. Are you ready to face the prime of this party?"
来吧，我保证这场游戏不会让你感到无趣的。,Come on. l assure you this will be fun.
我终究是输了吗……看来我太天真了……,I lose... It seems I'm only flesh and blood after all...
我很好奇，你为什么这么执着于战胜我……,I am curious why you are obsessed with defeating me...
呵……现实中的我，虽然身为你们所有神明的指挥官……,"Well... In the real world, although I am the commander of all gods..."
但同伴们真的认为我是值得追随的人吗？我真的能给她们带来信念与荣耀吗？,I don't think these gods truly believe I am the one worth following. I doubt myself whether I can bring faith and honor to my followers.
我原本想通过这场战斗的胜利，去证明自己是一名真正的领袖，哪怕我只是人类。,"I thought by deleting you, I could prove that even though I am a human being, I can be a true leader."
但没想到，即使拥有和你一样的创世之力，我却依旧以失败告终……,I did not expect this failure... Why do I lose to you even though I possess the genesis power same as you...
现实中的你，的确没有众神中最强的战斗技巧。,"In reality, you indeed don't have the best fighting skills."
然而你却拥有着众神难以具备的无私、团结、智慧、以及勇气之心。,"However, what you have is more precious: selflessness, unity value, wisdom, and bravery. Those are the gods' lack."
即使没有取得胜利，但在我心中你依旧是众神的领袖，从这场战斗起，至世界毁灭之时。,"Even if you lose, you are still the leader of all gods till the end of the world."
……我明白了，有你这番话，或许能让我斩断心中的那分犹豫。,... I see. Your words... means a lot to me... It relieves me from my doubt.
哼，这才像我认识的勇者！走吧，如此激烈的战斗过后，我已经等不及要泡进浴缸了……,"Humph, that's the person I know! Let's get the hell out of here. I can't wait to soak in the bathtub..."

头好痛……我在做梦吗？以及……潘多拉？你为什么会在这里？,"Aah, my head... Am I dreaming... Pandora? Why are you here?"
嘻嘻……看来如我所料的一样，你也误入梦境深渊了呐。,Hehe... Just as I expected. You had strayed into a dreamland abyss.
等下！你是不是在耍什么花招？你的表情让我嗅到了恶作剧的气息！,Wait! What are you planning? I have a sense that you are pranking me now.
别这么说，爱神大小姐，只有抱持难以释怀的愿望之人，才会来到这里。,Why do you say that? My dear Love Lady. This is the place for those who hold strong wishes.
啊！我想起来了！我每天晚上都发誓，要成为全世界最伟大的爱情使者！,If you say so... okay... Is it because I swear every night that I will become the most excellent Ambassador of love?
……好吧，你的愿望还真够离谱的，那么祝你好运。,...Well. That's pretty much a big wish. Good luck with achieving that.
哎？你不是来帮我达成愿望的吗？,Alas? I thought you were here to help me with that.
当然不是！我只是个引路人罢了，可没兴趣照顾你。,Me? Of course NOT! I am only a guide. I don't have the time to take care of you.
真是不负责任！像你这样的坏孩子要好好地教训一下呢！,How irresponsible! I guess someone needs a lesson from me.
喂！等……等下！你要做什么？！,What? Wait... stop! What are you doing?!
我认输了，快停手！,I yield. I yield! Stop that.
咦？我的力量好像下降了很多呢……老实交代，这是你恶作剧的结果吗？！,"Gee, I sense my power is not as strong as before... Tell me, is that your doing?!"
呃……很明显不是这样，你的力量遗失在梦境的各处，只有自己才能找回来。,"Well... Definitely not me! Your power is scattered in this dreamland, and you need to find them by yourself."
哎呀，现在这话是不是应该改成“我会帮你一块找回来”更合适呢？,You'd better add I will help you to find them at the end.
时间不早啦，亲爱的，告诉我接下来要去哪儿？,"It's late now. My dear, where will we be going?"
真糟糕，我发现自己的脑海里已经忘了“爱情”是什么了……,How terrible. I found that I have forgotten what love really is...
嗯？这有什么关系吗？,Huh? What does this have anything to do with our trip?
当然有关系啦！爱神的力量可是来自于对爱情的理念，如果连这个都忘了……,It sure does! The power of a love angel comes from the belief in love. If I already forget that...
呵呵……或许这是件好事，你以前对爱情那套死板的规则，可把人类整得够惨。,Hehe... Maybe that's a good thing. Your stupid rule of love really f**ked those human beings.
请问这里是……哎？！你们是……潘多拉和丘比特？,Hello there... Alas?! Pandora and Cupid?
哎？！你为什么会在梦境里，难道你也有想实现的愿望吗？,You... Why are you here? For an unachieved wish?
呃……确切说是的，我忘了自己真正的名字，好像只有回想起来后才能离开梦境。,"Ugh... Yes? I forget my real name... I guess if I want to leave here, I need to recall my name."
这可真够滑稽的……我们来打一场如何？如果你赢了的话，我就告诉你原本的名字。,"Funny... What about a fight? If you win, I will tell you your name."
如果你输了，就要告诉我爱情在你心中的含义，如何？,"If you lose, you gonna tell me what love means to you. How about that?"
哟，这主意不错，来吧！,That's a good idea. Come on!
啊……你比我想象中难对付得多……,Ah... You are tougher than I expected.
哼哼，那么遵守约定，告诉我你对爱情的看法吧。,"Humph. So, tell me your opinion about love."
呃……我也说不上来，但或许爱情……是一种朦胧的期待？,"Ugh... I really can't tell. But maybe, love is a hazy expectation."
朦胧地期待……吗？一个有趣的答案，我会好好记下来的。,"Hazy expectation... Well, that is an interesting answer."
等下！你真的不打算说出我的真名吗？我还指望着能离开这里呢！,Wait! You really do not intend to tell me my real name? I want to get out!
别担心，亲爱的，我可不是这么无情的家伙，在取回力量之后，我会告诉你的，回头见！,"Don't worry, my love. I am not such a cruel angel. I will tell you... after I retrieve my power! See you later~"
我感觉到自己的一部分力量就在附近，看来没走错路呢。,I sense that some part of my power is around here. We have come to the right place.
嗯？罗马的小爱神丘比特？难不成你来这里，是为了找回自己丢失的力量？,"Humph? Isn't this Cupid, the little love angel of Rome? Let me guess. You are here to get back your lost power."
猜得未免太准了些！那份力量在你手上吧？,That's right! Don't tell me you laid your dirty hands into my power.
没错，而且我并不打算还给你哟。,Indeed. And I am not going to hand it over to you.
那恐怕就要让你吃点苦头啦！,"Then, I guess you are about to suffer a bit!"
你这张可爱的脸，和你打架时的暴力程度可真不相称……,Does anyone tell you that your cute face looks so inconsistent with your fighting style?
哎，为什么你会对爱神的力量这么执着？,You tell me why you are so obsessed with the power of love first.
喔唷……看来你很难理解，在月亮上一个人呆几千年是什么感觉。,Mmm... You don't know what it feels like to live alone on the moon for thousands of years...
你不会是想使用我的力量去……召唤某个人？,"So, you are going to use my power to summon someone to... be with you?"
是啊，她和你一样精于弓箭，是我的故友……然而遗憾的是，她并没有降临这个世界。,"Yeah. She has good archery skills, just like you. My old friends... However, she didn't come here."
我挺想见见这个人的，哪怕只能在梦里。,"I really wish to meet her here, even just in this dream."
在我看来沉醉于梦境，只会带给人更多失望罢了，亲爱的。,But you will always wake up in the end. The dream only brings out more frustration.
或许如你所言，但至少爱情对于我来说，意味着一种思念。,"Maybe yes, maybe no. But at least I can feel love through these longing feelings."
思念么？感觉挺沉重的，但又有那么一丝温馨……,Longing? It sounds a little bit strong but somewhat sweet...
你会继续寻找自己遗失的力量吧？让我也来帮帮你好了……,"You are about to continue to find your lost power, right? Let me help you then..."
丘比特，来打一场吧！我很期待爱神的力量能让我的火焰变强多少！,"Cupid, come and fight with me! I am very curious about how the power of love can enhance my fire!"
天哪……我早该料到自己的力量，有可能会落到某些性格糟糕的家伙手上……,Gosh... I should know that my power may end up in someone like her...
我们不能坐下来好好谈谈吗？比如说你把力量还给我，我请你吃烤肉？,Can we just sit down and talk? I can take you to the barbecue if you are willing to give my power back.
想法不错！让我们开始餐前运动吧！,Good idea! Let's take a before-meal exercise!
等一下！你是不是没听明白我说的话？！,Wait! Do you even understand what I said before?!
真够呛，衣服差点被烧光，我这辈子再也不想和火龙打交道了……,I am this close to getting all my clothes burnt. Never and ever will I talk to anyone who can play with fire.
太可惜了，没想到即使获得了这么强的力量，竟然还会输给你。,It's a shame to lose to you after getting such great power.
我的力量可没这么容易驾驭，如果你对爱情没什么深刻的理念，是发挥不出来的。,"You really underestimate my power. If you don't have deep insights into love, I don't think you can master it."
深刻的理念？爱情不就是用如火焰般炽热的拥抱和亲吻，把你喜欢的家伙淹没么？,"Deep insights? To me, love is overwhelming hugs and hot kisses, burning yourself and the one you love with fire, right?"
如果这个家伙不答应和你交往，就把他打晕带回巢穴里，直到他同意为止。,"If someone does not accept your courting, just knock her out and take her back to your crib. She will agree eventually."
你为什么摆出这么一副惊讶的表情？爱情在我看来就这么简单。,What? Why do you look so surprised? That's what love means to me!
在我发疯之前，我还是快点去下一个梦境比较好……,"Before I go mad and knock you out, you'd better get out of my sight..."
喂！把我带上！力量还给你了！你还欠我一顿烤肉！,"Wait! Bring me with you! I give back your power, and you owe me one barbecue!"
冻死我了……这个梦境简直比北极还寒冷……,It's freezing... Where is this place...
一点也不奇怪，这个梦境是冰霜龙母的意志所诞生的。,I am not impressed since this dream is the product of that Frost Dragon.
千万别告诉我是你那个没有任何感情、冷得像块万年坚冰的北欧龙族姐妹。,Frost Dragon? Do you mean that cold as hell b***h?
别担心，我们人多，等会要是打起来胜算肯定不会小。,Don't worry. She is outnumbered.
小爱神丘比特吗？我知道你是来寻找自己丢失的力量。,"You are Cupid, the angel of love. I know you come here to find your power."
还好您是个通情达理的人，既然您已经知道了我的来意，那么……,"Finally, understanding beings. Since you know why I am here, why don't you..."
非常遗憾，然而我并不打算把这份力量还给你。,I am sorry. I will not give it back.
你看，我就说没必要废话吧，想说服她把力量还给你基本等于做白日梦，开打啦！,"See, I know there is no need to talk with her. Let's just fight!"
真是难对付！我这辈子也不会再想和冰龙打交道了！,This is tougher than I thought! You are really good with your ice skill.
看来，这份力量终究不属于我……,I guess this power is just not mine...
唉……我原以为像您这样存在，已经不在意爱情这种东西了。,I thought you didn't care about love since you have seen so many of it.
呵呵，恰恰相反，无论是人或神，都看重自己没有，或是难以得到的东西。,"Hehe, on the contrary. God or human, they all put more emphasis on things they don't have or are difficult to get."
虽然时间很短，但你的力量让我体验到了一种不曾有过的温暖，仿佛某个人的陪伴一样。,"Though the time is short, your power gives me a sense of warmth. It's just like I am with someone."
或许这就是所谓爱情的感觉吧，稍纵即逝，但让人无比珍惜。,Maybe that's what love feels like. Fleeting but precious.
听您这么说，多少让我多了一丝安慰。,I feel comforted by hearing you say that.
那么，作为给你带来麻烦的歉意，我就帮你一同取回丢失的力量吧。,"So, as an apology for your trouble, I will help you to retrieve your lost power."
在经历前两个梦境后，遇见你我一点也不感到意外。,I am not surprised to meet you here after what I have experienced.
而我也很清楚你迟早会站在我的面前。,"And I am pretty sure I will see you here, standing right behind me."
所以我猜，在我把遗失在你这里的力量取回来前，一场战斗是在所难免的，你说呢？,"I guess you and I have to fight before I can take my power from you, right?"
啊啦，我喜欢和说话直接而聪明的家伙打交道。,"Hehe, that's why I like to talk with smart people."
那么让我们开始吧，哼哼！,"Then, let's fight!"
你比以前强大了很多！相较于其他人，你很擅长运用从我这里得到的力量！,You are much more powerful than before! And your mastery of my power... much better than my two previous opponents!
雷电、风暴本身就和爱情一样多变而随性，你不觉得吗？,Maybe it is because the thunder is just as random and free as love.
正是如此，我才能将这份力量协调得这么完美。,Don't you think?
你这副性格我倒是一点也不讨厌呢，哼哼……,"Humph, I found your disposition quite attractive..."
哟，你这话是在暗示什么吗，亲爱的？,"What are you implying, my dear?"
你……你想到哪去了！,You... I didn't mean that!
啊啦，原来小爱神脸红的样子也很可爱呢。,"Alas, you look pretty when you blush."
让我加入你寻找力量的旅程如何？我挺想看看这件事发展到最后会多有趣。,Let me join your trip to gather your lost power. I would like to see how all these will end.
啊……我这辈子最不想见到的麻烦家伙出现了……,Ah... The last guy in the world I wanted to see is here...
哼，作为响应我召唤而来的爱情使者，这是什么失礼的话！,"Humph, you are just a little angel of love. How rude are you!"
希腊的天后赫拉阁下，您在爱情上有着自己的命运，即使是爱神也并不能扭转。,"Lady Hera, my dear queen. Love has its own path. Even I can't change it."
为了得到我心目中完美的爱情，我实在太需要你的帮助了。,I really need your help in getting the perfect love on my mind.
如果你不愿帮我，那么我只能依照梦境深渊的规则，夺取你全部的力量，独自去改变一切！,"Suppose you are not willing to help me. Then, I will take all your power and change the rule by myself!"
唉，即使拼尽全力，我最终还是输了，爱情已经彻底抛弃我了吗……,"I have tried my best, but I lost... Is love already abandoned me?"
我其实很想知道，您是怎么看待爱情本身的。,I wonder what love means to you.
还有什么比忠诚于彼此更重要的呢？即使贵为天后，爱情依旧是两个人的游戏。,"Loyalty. It means everything to me. Even though I am the queen of all gods, love is something that only can be shared through two beings."
而我的爱情却始终要面对众神的猜疑，经历各种磨难和考验，这未免太不公平了。,"But my love has to face the suspect by all gods, wanting through all the difficulties... It is not fair!"
和您所想的恰恰相反，风平浪静的爱情是不存在的。,"On the contrary, there is no love without trials."
爱情经历的曲折让它更有价值，如同钻石也需要打磨之后，才能焕发光辉一样。,"The troubles you meet when you are in love make love more precious. Just like diamonds, if you want it to shine, you must polish it first."
您对于爱情的忠诚，也始终是最珍贵的宝物，它最终是不会让您失望的。,Your loyalty to love is precious too. It will reward you eventually in someday.
……好吧，如果真的是这样，我或许也并不需要爱神的力量，来改变这一切。,...Well. Maybe I don't need your power to change everything if that's the case.
祝您好运，天后阁下。,"Good luck with finding your love, my lady."
嗯？看来有只调皮的小猫眯嗅到了爱情的气味，闯入我的梦境了呢。,"Well, is that a cute kitty who smells love and breaks into my dream?"
北欧爱神芙蕾雅！把我遗失在你这里的力量交出来！不然我的箭就要落到你的头顶啦！,"Freyja! Hands over my power, or I will shoot your head!"
哎呀呀，同为爱情女神，不觉得如果我立刻答应的话，就太无趣了吗？,"Alas, we are all goddesses of love. No need to act like that. Would it be boring if I just agreed to hand it over?"
那么一场较量应该会让你提起兴趣吧，哼哼……,"Fight me, then. That will be more interesting."
挺有自信的嘛，然而，你似乎忘了我的另一个身份呢……,You are confident. But... you have forgotten something...
另一个身份？,What?
北欧女武神统领者，英灵殿战争领主，在此向你挑战，来吧！,"I am also the Commander of Norse Valkyrie, Lord of the War of Valhalla. Come on! Let's fight!"
一场精彩的战斗，不是吗？,"That is a brilliant fight, isn't it?"
哼，很让我尽兴呢，我以为你只是个不谙世事的孩子罢了。,I enjoy it very much. I used to think you were just an inexperienced child.
小瞧我可是要吃大亏的呐。,You will suffer if you underestimate my power.
你的实力很让我青睐呢，要不要放弃罗马神系的神格，到北欧的英灵殿来？,"By the way, is there any chance you can join our Valhalla and give up your Rome deity?"
我向你保证，在北欧有更大的舞台，能让你好好发挥自己的实力。,"I assure you that, in our Nordic area, there will be a lot of opportunities for you."
如果有一天我玩腻了，想认真干点大事的时候，我会考虑的，哼哼。,Maybe. I will consider your offer if I get bored of all these and want to do something serious.
我感到只剩最后一块力量碎片没有找到了，会在哪儿呢……,There seems only one part of my power is out there. Where is it...
嗯……你的感觉没错呢，前辈。,Hmm... You do have good instincts.
大和的爱情使者，缘结神？好吧，这可真是命运的安排。,"Enmusubi, the love angel of Yamato? All right, that's the fate that plays tricks on me."
您遗失的最后一份力量，现在在我手上，但我并不想占为己有。,Your last lost power is in my hand. And I do not want to keep it to myself.
哎？！这是太阳从西边出来了吗？我可真没想过事情会解决得如此简单！,Really?! That's unusual. I never thought this could be solved so easily.
但我希望您答应我一件事，就是在得到完整的力量后，能全力与我一战。,But I hope you promise one thing. Don't go easy on me when you can fight with me with your full power.
看来你和我一样，对潘多拉魔盒许下过相同的愿望，对吧？,"I guess you have wished the same thing as I am, right?"
前辈对于爱情、缘分的理念，从千年前就和我有着巨大的分歧……,Your ideas about love and destiny are much different from mine thousands of years ago...
而所有爱神的力量，都源于这些理念，现在不正是证明谁的理念更有价值的时刻吗？,"But our power is all coming from that ideas. So, now is the perfect moment to prove who is right!"
有趣，那么就让我看看，我们彼此谁更能胜任“最强大的爱情使者”这一名号吧！,Interesting. Let's see who can win the title of the most powerful angel of love!
到此为止吧，我认输了，虽然已经拼上了所有的神力，但还是你略胜一筹。,That's enough. I lost.
呼……找回力量的感觉真是让我兴奋，仿佛重生了一般。,Phew... I feel wonderful to have all my power back. Like I have been reborn.
那么，前辈在经历这么多麻烦后，依旧会坚持自己对爱情的理念才是正确的吗？,"So, are you still trust in your belief in love after all this?"
是，我会坚持自己的道路！,"Yes, I will insist on going on my path."
那我就破例为您打开特别的梦境之门吧，让我看看前辈的“坚持”能否战胜更强大的对手。,"Then, I will open a special gate for you. Let's see how far your persistence can hold you."
哼，我可没那么容易退缩，倒不如说，我很期待面对更强的挑战！,"Humph, I will not easily be cowed. The challenge only excites my nerve."
呵呵……我相信前辈是不会后悔的，祝您武运昌隆。,Hehe... I know you will not regret it. Come on. I am looking forward to it.
不，对于爱情，每个人都有自己的答案。,No. Love cannot easily be defined. We all have an answer.
这个回答……呵呵，前辈似乎变得更成熟了呢。,It seems you have learned a lot on this trip.
与其强求一个答案，不如让人们自己慢慢体会，爱情的魅力不也正是如此吗？,"You can't force everyone to have the same answer, but let them feel on their own. And that's what is fascinating about love."
我会期待人们亲自向所爱之人，射出爱情箭矢的那一天到来……,I will look forward to the day when people can send their own love arrow by themselves.
我不在的这段时间，你玩得挺开心嘛，小捣蛋？,"You seem to enjoy yourself much when I am not around, my naughty girl."
母……母亲大人？！您怎么会在这儿？！,Ma... Mother?! Why are you here?!
我在听完你激昂的胜利宣言后，决定亲自进入梦境，试试你的力量。,"I heard your speech on love. And maybe, I owe you a lesson about it."
您是在开玩笑吧……,"You are making jokes, right?"
告诉我，亲爱的，什么是爱情？,"Tell me, my love. What is love, really?"
一点朦胧的期待，伴随着长久的思念，炽热如火但又温馨如蜜，时而随性但却终将永恒。,A bit of hazy expectation with longing; It burns like fire but sweet as honey; It feels random and selfish but will last forever.
虽然这说法并不让人觉得惊天动地，但这就是我现在对爱情的理念。,Maybe that sounds a lit bit corny. But this is my idea of love now.
很好……你和以前有了不小的变化呢，现在你或许能够担当真正意义上爱神的名号了。,Very well... You have changed a lot. Maybe it is time to give you the title of goddess of love.
但前提是，先过我这一关！,But... You have to beat me first!
哼，是我赢了呢，母亲大人。,"I win, mother!"
呵呵……意料之中的结果吗？你的成长比我想象中大得多。,"Hehe... That's what I have expected from you. You have grown fast, faster than I thought."
至少没让您失望就好……我一直期望着您的认同。,At least I haven't let you down... I am always looking for your recognition.
等你能够独挡一面时，我会让你继承罗马正统的爱神之位。,"When you can stand on your own, I will grant you the peace of Rome's goddess of love."
呃……这是不是意味着众神的爱情都会由我来引导？,Hmm... Does that mean I have to manage all the love affairs of gods?
天哪，我可不想整天面对一大堆众神的麻烦事！,Holy... I don't want to sit here all day worrying about their private life!
啊啦，到时候你就知道了……,"Alas, you will find out then..."

这是什么地方？我不记得我有入睡，是谁把我拉入了梦境之中？,Where am I? Is this a dream? I don't remember falling asleep. Did somebody draw me to this place?
我是潘多拉，秘密与求知的女神，这个梦境，是我的神力所形成的领域。,"Hey there. I am Pandora, the goddess of secrets and curiosity. Since you asked, this is a dreamland. This realm is built by my power."
亲爱的小猫咪，你将我拉入你的领域有何目的？,"Oh kitty, why did you bring me here?"
不，您是自己自愿且主动落入这个梦境的，它正是您即将面对的命运的具象化。,It wasn't me! You were lured here when I opened my box. Its magic is forcing you to confront your fate.
命运怎么可能束缚我？潘多拉，你的小把戏可真是胆大妄为呐……,"Fate? I haven't cared about that for a long time. And you think I will take your word for it? Pandora, your actions are bold and foolish."
哼……看来这梦境的结界确实不是你所控制的，否则在我击败你之后，你不可能继续维持梦境的魔法。,"Humph... Your weakness proves you can't control this place. Otherwise, this dreamland would have broken down when I defeated you."
为什么每次我都要被莫名其妙挨一顿揍……,I told you so! Why does everyone always insult me for no reason?
这个梦境本身就和您的命运以及意志联系在一起，击败我也并不能使您摆脱它。,This dreamland is connected to your fate and will. Defeating me won't change anything.
只有您亲自进入这段梦境，化解这一切，才能离开这里。,It's like a maze in your mind. Only you can find your way out.
我的命运与意志？姑且相信你，带路吧亲爱的。,"My fate and will? For now, I will assume you are telling the truth. You can lead the way, kitty."
奇怪，前面的火光是……？,That's strange! Do you see the fire ahead?
创世火种的余温，这么重要的东西怎么会出现在这儿？有趣……,That is the Flame of Origin! Why is something so important here? Interesting...
是谁，谁在那里？,Who... Who is there?
希腊神系的伊卡璐斯？你是从哪里得到这一团创世火种的？,Icarus? Why do you hold this sacred flame?
这是世界上最后一丝光明了，我要守护它直至找到传承者为止，不能让吞噬一切的黑暗染指它的光芒。,This is the last light of our world. I will protect it until I find someone who can take my responsibility. No one with darkness in their heart may approach.
那么恭喜你找对人了，来吧，是时候把它交给我了。,"In that case, I'm the right person to hold that for you. You may hand that to me."
然而非常遗憾，埃及的太阳神，在我的眼中你看上去并非是最佳人选。,"No, I disagree. Though you are the Egyptian god of the sun, you are not the best person to protect it."
啊啦，是吗？那么在接下来的战斗中，我会好好解除你的疑惑……,Is that so? Then maybe I can convince you by proving myself in combat.
呼……您身上竟然也有与创世火种相似的光芒……,Hoo... I am surprised to see that the flame inside you is like the one I hold!
再怎么说，我也是埃及的创世者之一，亲爱的。,"My dear, I am the god of sun, the world's greatest flame."
好吧，至少这团火焰在您手里，会比在我这儿更安全些。,Fine. At least this flame will be safer in your hands.
伊卡璐斯，我欣赏你直面烈日的勇气，和我一起离开这个虚无之地怎么样？,"Icarus, I admire your courage in facing the blazing light alone. How about joining us?"
明智的决定，我们出发吧。,I would be honored. Now let's get going.
埃及的太阳神拉，我早已预料到你会来到这里，同为太阳的化身，我很有兴趣看看谁的光芒更耀眼。,"Ra, I have been expecting you. Since we are all embodiments of the sun, are you interested in seeing who shines brighter?"
特洛伊的守护者，奥林匹斯山上的光明之主，阿波罗吗？,Apollo? The Guardian of Troy and the Lord of Light on Mount Olympus.
我是点燃宇宙的火焰，驱赶黑暗的明灯，而你我的相遇也正是命运的安排。,I am the fire that lit the universe and the light to drive away the darkness. And I believe that fate brings us together.
要想赢得我的认同，除非让我相信你的光芒更胜一筹。,"If you want to win my approval, you must prove that your light shines brighter than mine."
和传闻一样，你有着艺术家般的气质与高傲呢，那么就让我好好看看你的实力吧！,You're as proud as they say. Let's see your stuff. Bring it!
这就是你的力量吗，看来比我想象中强得多……,Your power... is much stronger than I thought...
然而并没有什么意义，如今我们都身陷梦境，离开这里才是最重要的。,"Our match doesn't mean anything since we are all stuck here. More importantly, we need to find a way out."
即使这里不属于太阳神领域，但以你的能力来说，突破梦境的结界不会是件麻烦事。,This is not the place for a God of the Sun to stay. I think you have enough power to break the enchantment of this dreamland now.
有你和我同行或许会轻松点，你不这么认为吗？,It will be easier if you join us. Don't you think so?
呵呵，一个天空可难以容纳两个太阳，而且我还有些私事没解决，暂时还不能离开这里。,"Heh! I don't think there is enough room for two suns in one sky. Besides, I have some private matters to deal with."
那太遗憾了，回头见，祝你好运。,"That's a shame. See you then, and... good luck!"
这里有股熟悉的能量气息，潘多拉，在我认识的众神中，还有谁掉入了你的梦境里？,"I sense other familiar gods nearby... Pandora, among the gods I know, who else has been trapped in your dreamland?"
嗯……我很难分辨具体是谁，但他们的神格能量，好像都是埃及的神明。,"Hmm... I don't know exactly who else... But, their divine energy indicates that some of them are from Egypt."
带我去找她们。,Take me to them.
不用找了，我就在这里。,Don't bother. I am here.
盖布，埃及的大地守护者……你为何会落入梦境，你也有希望实现的愿望么？,Geb? Why are you here? Has fate drawn you here as well?
并非如此，我和天空之神努特来到这里，只是为了保证您能安全离开而已。,It's not like that. Nuit and I are here to protect you. We need to ensure that you can leave this place safely.
不错的想法，糟糕的方法。因为在这个梦境中，除了战斗外，无法打开通往别处的门。,"Despite your good intentions, it is a foolish idea. The only way to open the door to the next dreamland is for Ra to defeat you in battle."
也就是说，战斗将是解决问题的唯一选择……？,I see. So the only way forward is for you to fight against me?
你猜对了，虽然我不介意作为侍奉者的你们对我刀剑相向。,"Yes. And for that reason, I will not be offended by your challenge"
那么请恕我无礼了……,"Then, forgive me, my lord... Let us do this!"
你的能力比现实中强大了很多……,You have grown much stronger.
而您的神力好像丢失了不少，看来梦境内无论是谁，都需要通过战斗，重新获得神力。,"But by defeating me in battle, you have taken some of my strength. It seems that you can only grow stronger by draining the power of the other gods."
如你所言，这也是一次考验，无论对谁。,I see. It seems that this is a trial for all of us.
我们出发吧，天空之神努特在前面的梦境中等着我们，她可没什么耐性。,"We'd better get going. Nuit is waiting for us, and she doesn't have much patience."
盖布你为什么会出现在这里？在没有找到主神之前，我们不是应该呆在自己的梦境中吗？,"Geb, why are you here? We are supposed to stay in our dreamland until our lord, Ra, arrives."
睁大你的眼睛看看就知道了，事情比我们想象中要快。,"Open your eyes, honey. She is right here."
努特，在你看来，呆在梦境里的感觉似乎挺不错的？,"Hello, Nuit. You look rather comfortable sitting here. Why didn't you seek me out?"
呀！原来盖布已经找到您了！害我白担心……,"Sorry! I was worried about you earlier... I see that Geb has found you. So, we can go now!"
事情没这么顺利，亲爱的，你我之间免不了一场战斗才能打开下一扇梦境之门。,"My dear, things are not that simple. We have to fight against each other to open the gate of the next dreamland."
哎？！只要打一架就行了？！那太简单了，我可是会全力以赴的！,What? A fight? That's simple enough for me. I will prove myself a worthy guardian to you!
你这家伙下手还真重……,Why did you do that? Was it necessary to attack with your full strength?
挺奇怪的，我的力量好像比平常更强了。,Strange. I sense my power has grown stronger than before.
没必要感到惊讶，这份强大的力量也是离开梦境所必需的。,"I think this place has released our hidden power. That's good! The stronger we get, the better chance we have to escape."
这样呐……那么我们接下来要去哪儿？,"I see... Then, where to next?"
在梦境之门后，我感受到了第三个埃及神明的气息，除了你们外还有人吗？,I sense another Egyptian god behind that door. Who else has come there besides you two?
好像阿努比斯也进入了梦境，但她似乎是响应另一个召唤者而来。,It may be Anubis. She is not with us. She came at someone else's request.
另一个召唤者？呵呵……看来有麻烦了。,Another god? I think that we've got a problem...
太阳神大人，我在此恭候多时了。,"My lord, the God of the Sun, I have been waiting a long time for you."
阿努比斯？你不看守冥界，来这里做什么？,"Anubis, you are supposed to guard the underworld. Why are you here?"
因为新的秩序就要来临了，太阳神大人，我将为更伟大的存在而收纳世间的灵魂。,"Because the new order is coming, my lord. Now, I am serving another great being."
“更伟大的存在”……这称呼可让我感觉不大妙。,"Another great being? No one can be greater than the Sun God, Ra."
太阳神大人，您可曾思考过自己灵魂的重量吗？,"We shall see about that. Have you ever thought about the weight of your own soul, my lord?"
我觉得或许让你亲自体会一下我灵魂的重量会更合适，亲爱的。,"My soul is powerful, and it can only be judged through battle."
好啦，审判的时刻到了，亲爱的，告诉我是谁召唤你来到这个梦境？,"Well, it is time to speak the truth. Tell me, my dear, who summoned you to this place?"
看来您忘了自己曾经的对手，那个象征亘古混沌，原初黑暗的野心家。,"Have you already forgotten her? Your former opponent, the God of Ambition, the symbol of eternal chaos."
……阿佩普？这没可能，她可没有那个神力能冲破我的封印，回到这个世界上。,...Apep? That's impossible. I sealed her away thousands of years ago. How did she escape?
她原本没有，但在潘多拉之盒所产生的梦境深渊里，她有这样的机会。,"When Pandora opened her box, its magic began luring gods into dreamlands like this one. Sensing Apep's desire to break free and defeat you, it drew her here for that purpose."
你指的是她如果彻底击败我，获得了我的力量……,And she wants to destroy me and steal my power for herself?
啊，看来您终于意识到了，不管怎么说，我认同的是纯粹的力量与秩序。,"Well, I see. I now realize why this is so important."
所以无论最后是她夺取了埃及神系的统治权，还是您粉碎了她的野心，我都会追随强者。,"However, I don't care if she steals your seat of power or whether you crush her ambitions. I only will follow the the strongest leader."
我尊重你的意愿，阿努比斯，你很快就会看到答案的。,"I will respect your choice, Anubis. You shall see who wins soon enough."
就快到达梦境的终点了，小心。,Be careful. We are nearing the final door.
奈芙蒂斯？天哪，我可不希望听到你也是应阿佩普的召唤，前来阻挡我的麻烦之一。,"Nephthys? Gosh, I really wish Apep hadn't summoned you to be on her side."
嗯哼，看来她已经失去了知觉，灵魂彻底迷失在梦境里了。,"Hmm, I think her soul is lost in this dreamland."
但是请小心，即使灵魂已经迷失，但她依旧非常危险，梦境会引导她的战斗本能。,"Please, be careful, for she is still dangerous. The dreamland will compel her to attack anyone who approaches."
看来只有通过战斗唤醒她的意志了……,Then we will bring her to her senses by defeating and subduing her.
啊……头好痛，我差一点就没能控制住自己，幸好您的出现及时阻止了这一切。,Ah... My head. I was so close to losing myself entirely. I'm glad you came along and stopped this from happening.
在梦境中迷失灵魂并不常见，看来你遇到麻烦了？,What happened to you?
我在进入梦境前感到一阵强大的黑暗之力，这种力量在不停召唤我。,"The last thing I recall is a strong, dark power luring me to open Pandora's box."
当我打开眼前的潘多拉魔盒时，一团黑色的雾气瞬间就占据了我的意志。,"When I opened it, a dense dark fog clouded my mind, and I blacked out."
阿佩普的魔咒吗？呵……看来我要找她算的账又多了一笔。,That sounds like one of Apep's spells. Yet another reason to find her and bring this to an end.
埃及的太阳神拉？阁下能来到这里真是出乎我的意料。,Ra? I am surprised to see you here.
天照吗？你的出现倒是没让我感到惊讶。,Amaterasu? I have to say that I am not surprised to see the Japanese Sun God here.
如果我没猜错的话，前面散发强大黑暗之力的地方，就是阿佩普所在的梦境吧？,"If my guess is correct, Apep is waiting just ahead. The place will be filled with her dark power."
精准的判断，我猜阁下是为了阻止阿佩普获得全部力量而来的？,You guessed correctly. Are you here to stop her from stealing your power?
既然你已经知道了我的来意，那么为何还要阻挡我的去路？,Yes. Why? Are you planning to stop us?
折返吧，我不想让你们进去送命，已经有不少试图阻止她的神明被她吞噬，成为了她的食粮。,"You need to go back. Many gods have tried to stop her, but they all failed. I don't want you to die for nothing."
这是我和阿佩普的私人恩怨，不管结果如何，还是需要我去了结。,This is a personal matter between Apep and me. I need to end this with my own hands.
如果你坚持要过去，那我必须测试你们的力量，即便作为主神的你，也要过我这一关。,"Apep has grown too strong. I fear that if you lose, she will become too powerful. If you insist, let me test your strength first."
你很强大，天照，我不得不承认同为太阳神，你拥有和我旗鼓相当的力量。,"You are strong, Amaterasu. I will give you that."
看来你决心已定，那么请务必谨慎行事，如果身为主神的你，力量被阿佩普所获得……,"You seem very determined. Remember, you must be careful. You can't lose to her..."
那么所有神系都可能会面临灭顶之灾。,"If your power is absorbed by her... The world will face a fatal catastrophe, and all the gods will suffer too."
我必然不会让你失望的。,Trust me. I will not let you down.
呵呵……姐姐，自从我的神力丢失之后，还从来没想过会有这样的机会重新向你发起挑战。,"Hehe... My sister, I have dreamed of the day when I could get my revenge for when you robbed me of my power."
好久没有听到你这让人不安的声音了，阿佩普，看来你的野心一点也没有消退。,"Long time no see, Apep. Your annoying voice hasn't changed, just like your unrealistic ambition."
你已经忘了吗？我生于黑暗，本就是要为吞噬一切而存在的。,Did you forget that I am born from the darkness and supposed to consume everything?
光可以创造一切，却也留下阴影，只有光明而没有黑暗的世界是不存在的。,"Light can create everything, but it leaves shadows behind. It's impossible to have a world without my darkness."
我没有忘记你的神权，但这个世界弥漫的黑暗已经够糟了，或许你保持沉默是最好的选择。,Of course I remember that. But this world has suffered enough from your darkness. You'd better step aside and stay silent now.
然而潘多拉之盒的梦境给了我这个机会，现在的你根本不是我的对手。,"No! Pandora's Box has given me a chance I've been dreaming of for thousands of years. With all the power I've absorbed, you are no match for me!"
然而即使你现在已经非常强大，也要直面我这个最后的阻碍不是吗？,So you think! I shall show you how little power you have.
让我们开始吧，呵呵……,"Then, no more talking. Let's fight!"
哼……没想到即使拥有这样的力量，你最终还是败给了你……,No! Why?! I possessed so much power... How did you still beat me?
回去吧，阿佩普，回到你应该待的地方。,"Go, Apep. Go back to where you came from and stay there forever."
我会回来的，在那无光的未来，我会回来结束你的神权……,"One day, I will be back for you, and I will end you with my own strength!"
危机已经解除了，光明重回了天空，或许我们也该离开了。,We did it! The light is returning to the sky! I think it's time for us to leave this place.
有些不对劲，我感到阿佩普所带来的黑暗已经消散，但还有一丝黑暗似乎潜藏在梦境的更深处。,"I still feel something is wrong... Although the darkness brought by Apep has been dispelled, something dangerous is hiding deeper in this dreamland."
我也有这种感觉……,I have the same feeling too...
前面好像还有一扇隐藏的梦境之门，如果要去调查的话，阁下请务必小心。,There might be a hidden door ahead. You must be careful.
应该只是阿佩普残留的力量而已。,I suspect that it's the lingering remnants of Apep's power.
或许是我多心了吧，阁下准备离开梦境了吗？,Then maybe I'm wrong. Are you ready to leave this place?
嗯，我想尽快回到现实，这件事之后，我应该好好提升一下自己的警戒心。,"Yes, I want to leave here as soon as possible. After all of this, I need to be more alert in the future. I can't let this happen again."
而这在梦境中获得的新力量，希望也能让太阳神的信念更加深入人心。,"And as for this new power I gained here, I will use it to spread more light and restore people's faith in the sun."
能发现幕后的隐藏者，您可真出乎我的意料，看来黑暗无论如何隐藏，都躲不掉光明的探知。,I'm surprised you found me. I should have known that darkness cannot hide from the light.
奥丁……？等等！不……你的灵魂中透出的是黑暗的气息，你并不是奥丁！,Odin...? Wait! Your soul feels so evil... You can't be Odin!
呵呵……那么，您猜猜看我是谁。,"Hehe... Then, who am I?"
哼，我可没心思猜，直接用实力让你告诉我不是更合适吗？！,Don't waste my time. Let's fight and settle this.
我受够了你的小把戏，奥丁……不，洛基！,"I am tired of your little tricks, Odin. ... No, wait! Loki is known for her tricks. You're Loki in disguise!"
被您看出来了呢。,"Alas, you have unmasked me."
阿佩普是你引诱至此的？不，你没这个能耐，即便奥丁本人也做不到。,Was it you who lured Apep here?
呵呵……您就继续猜吧，从潘多拉魔盒打开的那一刻，众神的命运就已经开始变化了。,"Hehe... Keeping guessing, and you may find the truth~"
很好，很快我会亲临阿斯加德，然后亲手把你揪出来问个明白。,Fine! I will go to Asgard and learn the truth for myself.
事情可没你想的那么简单，太阳神大人，不过今天我已经没心情和你们玩了，再见。,But I'm not going to stick around and give you any hints. Goodbye for now.
跑得可真快，不过在梦境里我也没有办法阻拦她……,Wow! She's fast and slippery. It's a shame I couldn't stop her from escaping this dreamland.
潘多拉魔盒的梦境究竟是怎么回事，为什么我感到一场阴谋正在酝酿……,What's really going on with this place? Why do I feel there is more behind all these...
呼……希望是我多想了，不管如何，先回到现实再说吧……,Hoo... I hope I am overreacting. Let's return to the reality so that I can figure out my next step.

我，我这是在哪？,Where am I?
真是稀客啊，我这里，可是好久都没开张了呢。,What a wonderful surprise. I haven't seen anyone for a long time.
你是谁？我这是在什么地方？,Who are you? What is this place?
我是潘多拉，你可以叫我求知与秘密之神。,"I am Pandora, the god of knowledge and mystery."
只有渴求未知或者寻求答案的人才会落入我的梦境，呵呵，小妹妹，你是为了什么而来呢？,"This is a place for people looking for an answer to the unsolved questions deep in their minds. Little girl, why did you come here?"
我在渴求什么……吗？,Hmm... an answer to the unsolved questions...
对，你好好想想。,"Yeah, think carefully."
我在寻找一对不畏风暴，不惧烈焰的光芒之翼！,I think I am looking for a pair of wings that could carry me over the storms and the flames!
哦呵呵呵，哎呀，这可不是件容易的事呢，尤其对于你这样神格不全的人来说。,"I am surprised that you have come to the answer so quickly. But this is not easy, especially for a half-god like you."
不过嘛，我有几位客人，或许能够帮你找到答案，但她们非常傲慢。,"However, I happen to know a few residents here who can help you."
我想，我得先测试测试你有没有资格去见她们。,"I can introduce you to them, but first, I want to know whether you are worthy of my help."
停手，停手！你把我打痛了，笨丫头！,"Stop! Stop!!! You hit me, and it hurts, you stupid girl!"
那么，你认输了吗？,So am I worthy of your help?
我承认之前确实小看了你，但真想让我给你认输可没这么简单，这一次就算你赢了吧。,I admit that I underestimated you. You have my respect for now.
那么，劳烦你给我带路了，潘多拉。,"Then, lead the way."
我可以帮你，不过你要记住了。,"I will do this for you. But remember, as soon as you have what you want and leave the dreamland, please encourage others to come here as well."
等你找到你想要的，别忘了出去后多帮我揽揽生意，宣传宣传求知与秘密女神的名号。,"Tell them that I welcome everyone to this dreamland, and this is an excellent place to make your dream come true. Will you?"
呐，前面唱歌的就是海妖。她知道关于你要的光明之翼的消息，你要不先上去问问？,"Look, the one singing in front is Siren. She knows everything about your dream wings. Go and ask her."
我的爱人啊，低头看一看，在这无尽海洋上，我就是那汪甘泉……,"♫My love, please look around. In the endless sea, find me by my sound...♫"
这位姐姐，你唱的是什么歌，真好听。,"Hey sister, what song are you singing? It sounds lovely."
妹妹，你长得真美，过来，过来，让姐姐，教你点好玩的东西。,"Oh, thank you. What a beautiful girl you are. Come. Come closer. I can teach you how to sing."
可别怪我没提醒你，小姑娘，这海妖歌声的吸引力，无论男女，都是致命的。,"Stop! She is trying to lure you. The singing voice of Siren is deadly to both men and women, humans and gods."
呀，好险，我差一点就被她迷过去了。,I was so close to believing her words.
潘多拉，这小姑娘是谁？,"Pandora, who is this girl?"
她是伊卡璐斯，一只迷途的小凤凰，想要寻找一幅传说中神才能拥有的翅膀。,"She is Icarus, a phoenix who has lost her way. She is looking for to a pair of wings only a god can possess."
海妖，我正在寻找一对不畏风暴和烈焰的光芒之翼，你知道在哪可以找到它吗？,"Siren, I want these wings so I can fly across the storm and flames."
啊哈哈哈，你这样的人类，也妄想获得神明的翅膀吗？,"Haha, a human who desires the holy wings; I haven't seen something so crazy thing in ages."
不说我不知道，就算我知道，我为什么不自己独吞，而非要等到现在告诉你呢？,"Even if I knew where the wings were hidden, I wouldn't share them with you. I'd keep them for myself."
那好吧，你不愿意告诉我，我也没办法。潘多拉，麻烦你带我去你的其他朋友那吧。,"Fine. If you are not willing to tell me, it is your choice. Pandora, let's keep moving."
站住！你觉得不留下点什么就能从我这离开吗？,Wait! I don't think I can let you leave so easily.
你身上的气息很好闻，是那种凡人追求神格的气息，来吧，让我吸一口。,"You smell good, a scent of a doomed ambition. Come, let me take a bite."
我不想和你打，但你非要这样的话，我也不是好惹的！,"I don't want to fight you. But if you insist on insulting me like that, I have no choice but to defend my honor."
怎么样，现在知道我的厉害了吗？,Is that what you want? Have you surrendered?
你一介凡人，为什么会有这样的力量？,How did a human obtain such power?
只要坚信光明，就没有什么能够难到我！,"If you believe in the light, nothing is impossible!"
好了，海妖，你还记得我们的赌局吗？,"Alright, Siren, you lose. Are you going to continue crying like a baby, or do you want to come with us?"
愿赌服输，我会帮助你们渡过接下来的难关的。,Take me! I want to join you on your trip and watch these events unfold!
这里是瓦尔基里的地盘，留意天空，她们一般会趁你不注意，从上方发起进攻。,We are entering the territory of Valkyrie. Be careful of the sky. She will attack you from above while you're not paying attention.
我看到她了，是瓦尔基里！,I see her. Valkyrie is right there!
你们几个，在我的领空下面干什么？,What are you doing here?
瓦尔基里，我来这里只是想向你请教一个问题。,"Valkyrie, I am here to ask you to give me some guidance."
你问吧。,About what?
我在寻找一对不畏风暴，不惧烈焰的光芒之翼，你有看见过它吗？,I am looking for a pair of wings to help me cross the storms and the flames. Have you ever heard of it?
那也正是我一直在追寻的翅膀，你和我打一场吧，你赢了，我就帮你去找它。,I have also craved such wings for a long time... It looks like we'll have to fight each other to decide who has the right to own it! The one who loses must help the winner to find it.
虽然我不喜欢战斗，但假如我不得不面对挑战的话，我也会严阵以待的！,"I don't enjoy fighting. But if I must, then I accept your challenge"
够了！你证明了你自己，现在，我愿意跟随在你身边，寻找那传说中的双翼。,Enough! You have proven yourself... I am willing to follow you and help you find the wings.
那就拜托你了，瓦尔基里。,"Thank you, Valkyrie."
我接下来要指引你去天使的领地，如果想获得传说之翼，就必须要得到她们的祝福。,"I will now take us to the Land of the Angels. If you want to get those wings, you must win their approval first."
天啦，来了好多好多漂亮的姐姐，你们是来找丘比特，询问爱情的吗？,"Gosh, so many lovely girls here. Do you three plan to ask me about your destined love?"
不，丘比特，我正在找一对光芒之翼。,"No, Cupid. I am looking for a particular pair of wings."
哦……你是说，你要找祝福之翼？,Hmm... Do you mean the Wings of Light?
祝福之翼？,Wings of Light?
据说，如果有凡人想要获得神格，那么她必须先得到天使的祝福。,It is said that the one who owns this pair of wings and is blessed by three angels can have the chance to become a goddess.
那么丘比特，你能给我祝福吗？,"So, Cupid, can you give me the blessing?"
不行。除非，你能接住我的爱情之箭！,"No, I don't bestow my blessings freely. First you must... prove that you are faster than my arrow of love in combat. Fight me!"
好的，我会接住你的箭证明给你看的！,"Well, I will prove I am worth it."
伊卡璐斯，你赢得了胜利。,"Stop, Icarus. You have won."
谢谢你，丘比特，你本来有机会击败我的。,"Thank you, Cupid. This was a fair fight. I won only through luck."
嘻嘻，没关系，告诉我，伊卡璐斯，得到祝福之后，你会怎样去使用它呢？,"That's fine. I can live with the occasional failure. But, tell me, Icarus. What would you do after I give you my blessing?"
你会谈开始一场热烈的爱情吗？,Are you seeking love?
我……我不知道。,I... I don't know.
好了，快别闹了，给我们赐福，然后带我们去你的姐姐们哪里吧。,"Alright, stop teasing her. Bless her and take us to your sisters!"
如你们所愿，我以爱情之名，赐予你祝福，伊卡璐斯！,"As you wish. I, Cupid, bless you, Icarus, in the name of love."
快点，前面就是米迦勒的圣堂了，她人很好的，我和她说说，她应该就会把祝福给你们了。,Come on! Michael's holy church is just steps away. She is a lovely angel. I will talk to her about the blessing.
你说谁的圣堂来着，小家伙。,Whose holy church are you talking about?
路，路西法？你，你怎么会在这里？,Lu... Lucifer? What are you doing here?
有意思，我好像记得，我并没有邀请你来我的梦境做客。,Interesting. I don't remember inviting you here.
的确，不过你们这有团微小但刺眼的光，让我十分在意。,Indeed. I saw a bright ball of light in the distance..
我就想来看看，这团追逐天空的微光，究竟是个什么样的东西。,So I came here to see what kind of light it was.
我现在就在你面前，路西法。,"I guess you are looking for me, Lucifer."
哦……不错嘛。那我们开始吧，如果你能让我满意，我就代替米迦勒，降下天使的祝福。,"Right... Then, I claim the right to a challenge! If you win, I will give you a blessing on behalf of Michael."
我不会退缩的，地狱之王，我会让你见识一下我的勇气，我的信念！,"King of Hell, I will not hold back. I will show you my strength and my faith!"
怎么样，你认输了吗？,Do you yield?
不错不错，你确实配得上勇气天使的祝福。,"Yes, I yield. You are indeed worthy of the blessing."
我就代替米迦勒，为你送上勇气的赐福！,I will fulfill my promise.
不得不说，伊卡璐斯，你看起来变得更坚定，也更自信了。,"I must say, Icarus. You look more determined and confident after the blessing."
真，真的吗？我真的有变得坚定吗？,Really?
每一段追求，都是使人成长的过程，要想拥有神一样的双翼，这是你的必经之路。,Yeah. It seems that your pursuit of the wings has made you grow.
圣光，已经预示了你的到来，伊卡璐斯。,"Icarus, welcome. The light of fate has foretold your arrival."
那么，智慧天使，你愿意给予我你的祝福吗？,"Raphael, the angel of wisdom, are you willing to bestow your blessing on me?"
我当然愿意，但对于你来说，这智慧太过沉重，我必须考验你，看你有没有资格承担它。,Sure. But I worry the wisdom in my blessing will be too much for you to handle. You must pass my trial first.
来吧，智慧天使，我已经做好准备了！,Come. I am more than ready now!
现在，我有资格接受这份祝福了吗？,"Now, am I qualified for your blessing?"
你的智慧毋庸置疑，做好准备，我将开悟你的思维。,I am surprised by your potential. I will now widen your mind with my blessing.
感谢你，拉斐尔。,"Thanks, Raphael."
有了三位天使的祝福，现在我应该有资格得到那对光芒之翼了。,I think I am now qualified to get the Wings of Light with the blessing of three angels.
伊卡璐斯，获得我们的祝福并不是终点，你还需要面对那曾经的天空主宰——巨龙的考验。,"Icarus, our blessings are just the ticket to the next destination. You have to face the dragons, the former champions of the sky."
我明白了，拉斐尔，请你送我到达她们身边吧！,"I see. Raphael, please take us to them!"
快看，姐妹，有人闯入了我们的天空！,I sense someone trespassing on our territory.
很好，很好！我要让她们尝尝，被火焰炙烤的滋味！,"Well, I have to say that I can't wait to set something on fire!"
不要急，让我先去会会她们。,"Don't rush, my sister. Let me discover their intentions first."
停下！你们来到我们的领空，意为何图？,Stop there. Who are you? Why are you here?
冰霜龙母，我是伊卡璐斯。,"Frost Dragon, I am Icarus."
伊卡璐斯？我听说过你，天空和海洋，曾经提起过你的名字。,Icarus? I have heard of you from the spirits of the sky and sea.
她们说，你为追求天空，最终被烈日烧尽了羽翼，坠入了大海。,"They say your ambition led you to fly towards the sun, and it burned your wings, sending you crashing into the sea."
上天给了我神格，给了我力量，让我免受死亡。我要用这新的生命，飞得更高，更远！,"But the spirits of the sea and sky helped me evade death. Now I want to use my new life to fly even higher. To achieve that, I must find the Wings of Light!"
所以，你想寻求龙族的考验？,"So, are you here to ask about the Trial of Dragons?"
是的，请你们为我指明道路。,"Yes, please light the way for me."
很好，那就看你的双翼，能不能跟得上我的速度！,"Great. Then, I will see whether you can keep up with me!"
你通过了我的考验，你的双翼经受了冰霜与风暴，去吧，准备好迎接下一场挑战。,"Since you have passed my trial, your wings have been strengthened by both frost and storm. Go. My sister is waiting for you."
既然我的姐妹没有让你退缩，那就让我来感受一下，巨龙的怒火！,I will let you feel the anger of fire!
我已经准备好了接受你的试炼了，灰烬女王！,"Queen of Embers, I am ready to accept your trial!"
我已经击败你了，灰烬龙女！,"I have just defeated you, Ember Dragon!"
不，刚才只是个小小的失误，我还没有输！再和我打一次！,"No, it was only luck. I haven't lost yet!"
没这个必要，姐妹，她已经通过了考验。,"That won't be necessary, my sister. By luck or not, she has passed your trial."
我们将会为你打开一扇直接通向你灵魂深处的门，你将在那里遇到你最大的考验。,"We will open a gate that goes all the way to the deepest depths of your soul. In there, you will find your final trial."
只有击败它，你才能获得真正的胜利。,Only by defeating it can you leave here.
看来，我们终于到了这场梦境的终末。,It seems we have come to the end of our journey.
向前走吧，伊卡璐斯，那道光，就是你苦苦寻求的东西。,"Icarus, you must be careful."
哦……瞧瞧这是谁来了，一个妄想飞越太阳的无知少女！,Look who it is! An innocent girl who dreams of flying towards the sun!
怎么，还没吸取教训，还想尝试一下双翼被烤焦的痛苦吗？,So you haven't learned your lesson?
我已经不是当初那个弱不禁风的我了，我的信念，我的勇气，都得到了天使的祝福！,I am no longer the girl I was. I have the blessings of angels.
我，通过了巨龙的考验，我，必将飞越太阳，飞越你！,And I have passed the trial of dragons. I will defeat you!
哈，那就来吧！,Then come on and fight me!
我赢了，我终于做到了！我超越了你，阿波罗！,I win! I finally made it!
阿波罗……？,Apollo?
她消失了。当然了，她只不过是你心中无法越过的阴影。,"She's gone. She was just a projection of your mind, a shadow of the real Apollo."
当你战胜了她，就是战胜了你自己的内心。,"When you defeated her, you beat your inner demon."
好了，上前去吧，阿波罗的幻影消失时留下的那道光，就是你所追求的光芒之翼。,Those are the Wings of Light that you sought.
伊卡璐斯，我就是你的光芒之翼。你现在拥有了我，但我还需要问你最后一个问题。,"Icarus, I am the Wings of Light. Before you become my master, I have one question for you."
什么问题？,What is the question?
这世上有许许多多身体残疾的人，他们没有了手，或者没有腿，甚至没有了眼睛。,"There are lots of disabled people in the world. Some are missing hands or legs, and some don't even have eyes."
假如我告诉你，你将我献出去，便能给他们光明，给他们希望；,"If you give me to them, then they will be healed. But if you take me all to yourself, you will have the chance to become a real goddess."
而你将我占据，你则拥有完整的神格，得到晋升为正式女神的资格，你会怎么选呢？,Which will you choose?
我会献出你，因为我追求的光明，就是这个世界的光明！,I will give you to them.
你的回答我很满意，你的高尚让你赢得了这次晋升。,I am satisfied with your answer. Your nobility has won you the chance of becoming a goddess.
接受这份力量吧，你将成为新的光明女神，去为世界带来希望！,"Take this power, and you will become the new God of Light, bringing hope to the world!"
我不会辜负你的期望。,I will not let you down.
我会占有你，我追求光芒之翼，就是为了成为真正的女神！,I will take you all to myself.
你追求的，仅仅只是完整的神格吗？,"So you are chasing glory, not righteousness?"
那么按照规则，你要面对另一位和你同时追求这次晋升机会的人一教高下！,"Then, by the rules, you must fight someone else who shares your ambition."
顺应召唤而来吧，圣女贞德！,"Jeanne d'Arc, I summon thee!"
伊卡璐斯！让我们公平决斗吧！,"Icarus, let's have a fair fight!"
我接受你的挑战，贞德，我要让你明白，什么样的人才真正有资格成为女神！,"Sure. Jeanne d'Arc, I will let you see what kind of power it takes to become a real goddess."
我……失败了，胜利……属于你。,I... failed. Victory belongs to you...
好了，光芒的双翼，臣服于我，成为我登天的力量吧！,"Alright! Wings of Light, obey me and take me to the sky!"
遵命，新晋女神，赐予你理应所得的力量与权威。,"Yes, my goddess. I will grant you the power you deserve."
……哼哼哼，当然还有不可或缺的……傲慢。,Hmmm… You forgot to mention that you will also boost her arrogance!
没有比翩翩起舞的樱花雨更美的景色了……你懂樱花的花语吗？,Nothing can be compare to the senery of cherry blossom rain… do you what cherry blossom symbolizes?
其实呢，我一直在想。跳舞的时候拿把更大的扇子会比较好吗？,"Actually, I’ve been thinking. Would it be better to take a bigger fan while dancing?"
那个……明天晚上你会跟我一起去赏花吧？,That… will you go with me tomorrow night to enjoy the flowers?
万物的复苏。,The recovery of everything.
一起跳舞吧？,Let's dance together.
应该……是粉色吧。,It should be... pink.
是思念的意思吗？,A sense of longing?
我觉得没必要那样。,I don't think so.
猜猜我会不会去呢。,Maybe I will come. Maybe not.
雨真多啊。,It's rainy.
一决胜负？,Let's fight each other.
也许红色比较好,Maybe red is better.
嗯……爱情？,Hmm... Love?
那必须还是大的漂亮！,The bigger one will be much prettier.
我一定会去的！,I'm sure I'll go!
嗯，就像你说的，春天，象征着绽放的鲜花，苏生的生命……还有爱情。,"Well, as you said, spring symbolizes blooming flowers, the life that comes back... and love."
好啊好啊！我可会跳舞了，你想和我跳哪一段呢？,"Sure! I am a great dancer, which part do you want to dance with me?"
粉色……那是樱花的颜色！说不定有什么深刻的意义呢,Pink... that's the color of the sakura! What are you suggesting...
是的，无论身在何方，樱花总代表着游子心中最殷切的思念。,"Yes, wherever they are, cherry blossoms always represent the longing thoughts of the wanderers."
我也是这么想的。扇子小，轻巧灵活，太大了话，连展开都变得困难了。,I think so too. Little fan is more flexible.
讨厌，我才不猜！反正明晚你不来我就再也不跟你说话了,"Humph! If you don't come tomorrow night, I won't talk to you anymore."
和爱慕的对象打伞在街上散步……不觉得很浪漫吗？,Walking in the street under an umbrella with your loved one... So romantic!
好像相当有自信哦！那输了可不要哭鼻子！,"You seems quite confident. If I beat you, don't become a crybaby."
喜欢热烈活泼的红色吗？嗯！我也要努力变得更加鲜艳呢！,The warm and lively red? I think I have to try my best to became brighter from now on!
啊，美好的爱情，就像书上说的那样……可我也没体会过呢。,"Oh, beautiful love in the story... where I can find one for myself?"
是啊，大扇子还可以用来打人，想想那呼啦呼啦的样子，就觉得好厉害呢。,Yeah! And you can slap someone with that. So funny!
说好了哦，到时候我会穿上最漂亮的和服等你。,Then we have a deal! I will wear my most beautiful kimono and wait for you there.

我终于等到这一天的到来，小樱真的太幸福了！从今往后，愿我这朵樱花，永远只为你一个人而盛开……,"This day finally come. I am so happy! From now on, I will only bloom for you till the end of my life."
她原本并非大和神话中的传统神明，但源自于人类对她的信仰和崇拜，使得她具有了强大的神格与力量。\n她的诞生与过往一直是个迷，但她总是能给人们带来美好的祝福，让人沉醉。,Sakura Spirit is not a traditional god in Yamato mythology. Her divinity and power are born from the human admiration of cherry blossoms offered during a springtime custom known as hanami.\nHer past has always been a mystery. Yet people still believe in her power to bring happiness.

神圣之鹿,Sacred Reindeer
麋鹿诞生自爱尔兰荒凉的苔原上，她最初只是一个流浪在荒原上的小鹿，因为保护同伴不被人类偷猎而牺牲。圣诞女神在经过苔原时，发现了她，感叹于她的牺牲和勇气，于是将自己的神格分享给了这头小鹿，令她复活，并得到了一幅少女的美貌，让她为自己驱使雪橇。,"Finette was born in the desolate tundra of Ireland. As a fawn, she sacrificed herself to protect her herd from human poaching. Xmas Angel witnessed the tragedy while passing through the tundra and marveled at Finette's courage. She rescued Finette and shared her godhood with the fawn. As a result, Finette can now take human form, though she often remains a reindeer to pull a sleigh for the maiden who saved her life."
哎？！你怎么找到这来了？已经到圣诞节了吗？,What? How did you find this place? Is it Christmas already?
啊，原来是你啊。你有看到一个盒子吗？嗯……方方的，上面缠着彩丝带。,"Ah, it's you. Did you see a box? Um, it's square, and it's wrapped with colorful ribbons."
啊啊啊啊！下面的人小心！我要掉下来啦！,Aah!!!! Watch out down there! I'm falling!
糟了，我把雪橇给弄丢了，这下子又要罚站了……要不你陪我一起站吧！,"Oh no, I lost my sledge again. Lady Xmas will punish me for that... What about you take the punishment for me?"
主人，人家的角又开始痒痒了，能让人家在你身上蹭蹭吗？,"Master, my horns are itch again. Can you let me rub on your body?"
主人，主人，今年圣诞节你想要什么礼物呢？姜饼，巧克力，还，是，我？,"Master, what would you like for Christmas this year? Gingerbread? Chocolates? or... me?"
雪下得好大……今晚什么时候出门呢主人？孩子们一定都等不及了。,"It's snowing heavily. What time will you go out tonight, master? The kids are gonna be so excited."
又见面了，今后，你就是我的主人了。快坐上来，让我用雪橇，载着你周游世界吧。,"Hello again, from now on, you are my master. Hop in, and I'll take you around the world in my sleigh."
主人，我……我还是感觉床……有点太小了，我的脚……老是会伸出床边。,"Master, I think I still feel my bed is too small... My feet always stick out of the bed."
主人，主人，快让我躲躲，那只小兔子，又吵着要礼物了！,"Master, please let me hide there. That annoying rabbit is clamoring for gifts again!"
啊，主人，能再借你的腿我睡一会吗？我真的很喜欢这种感觉，睡在你身边的感觉……很安全。,"Ah, master, can I borrow your leg again and let me sleep there for a while? I really like this feeling. Sleeping beside you feels very safe."

我还没有和十二地支的姐妹见过面呢，听说有很凶悍的家伙，不会欺负我吧？,I haven't met any of my sisters of twelve earthly branches. I heard that some of them are quite aggressive. Will they bully me?
当一位地支神非常忙，要是碰到本命年，整年都得值班……,"Being a god of the Twelve Earthly Branches is not easy. If it is your year in the zodiac, you are on duty all year round."
你好像把我和月宫的小兔子弄混了呢。,You seem to have me confused with that bunny on the moon.
我想和你在一起，就这样一直下去，直到世界末日降临……,"I want to be with you, just like this, until the end of the world."
寅虎和我，你更喜欢谁？,"Who do you prefer, Zodiac Tiger or me?"
你对赛跑感兴趣吗？不如我们来比赛吧！,Are you interested in running? Let's have a race!
哼哼……说不定。,Hmm... maybe... *impish grin*
其实也就那样……,Well... I have to work every year too.
哎？你不是月兔吗？,Ahh? You are not Xiyu?
已经世界末日啦！,But this is the end of the world.
当然是你了！,Of course it's you.
才不要和兔子比赛跑！,Racing with you? A rabbit? A big no!
这我可不大清楚……,I barely know any of them.
你可以摸鱼呀。,I think you can slack off from your work from time to time.
我还是能分清的。,I sure can tell the difference!
（保持沉默）,(Remain silent)
这个嘛……你猜猜？,Hmm... want to take a guess?
好啊，要赌一局吗？,Sure. Want to take a bet?
我怎么感觉你满脸坏笑的表情，你好像有非常糟糕的期待啊……,What are you thinking? Your expression betrays your wicked thoughts.
哼，要不你来替我做一天事情看看？,"humph, why don't you do my job for a day and see how hard it is?"
当然不是！你好好看看，月兔的身材，有我这么火辣吗！,Of course not! She doesn't have such good figure.
那就索性让我再抱一会吧……,Then hold me a little longer...
比起大大咧咧的家伙，大家还是喜欢温柔的女孩多一点哦。,I think everyone prefers a tender girl like me.
论赛跑，我说第二，可没人敢说第一！哼哼……,"Of course you wouldn't dare to race with me, since I am the fastest of the fast."
没关系，我可是一直有锻炼的哟，她们不一定打得过我呢！咻！咻咻！,It's okay. I have grown a lot stronger. They stand no chance of bullying me!
那可不行，要是我算错了时间，一定会被教训的很惨的……,"Haha, I can't do that. If I stopped paying attention and I lost count of the days, I'd be doomed."
是吗？我还以为你们人类，会把所有的兔子都看成一样的呢。,Yeah?  I thought you human think all the rabbits are the same.
蹭蹭，再蹭蹭，真舒服……,(Rubbing) I like to stay with you.
哎呀……看来肯定是我了，你的表情已经透露了一切！,I am sure it's me! I can see it in your eyes.
好啊，如果你输了，就得陪我出去约会一整天！,"Well, if you lose, you gotta to take me to a date."
你就是与我签订誓约的人类吗？哼哼，从今天开始，就会由小兔陪伴在你左右了，还请多多关照呢！,Are you the human who wish to vow to me? I will accompanied by your side from now on. Remember to come and see me if you got the time!

As punishment, she was sent down to Earth to use her divine power to save others by dispelling their diseases."

这份只属于你的春节贺礼，是否触动心弦？,A look that represents the new beginning of a year.
战争，鲜血……死亡，我子民的……挣扎。我是谁？我在哪？,... Who am I? Where am I?
锵锵！看看这是谁醒过来了！,"Well, well, well, look who it is."
欢迎来到潘多拉的魔女占卜店，有什么可以让我效劳的吗？,"Himiko, welcome to my territory. Is there anything I can do for you?"
我……我想不起自己是谁了，一合上眼，就看到满河的尸体，破损的战船和……血。,"I... I can't remember who I am. When I close my eyes, horrible images fill my mind. Dead bodies, broken ships, and... blood."
看来我们伟大的日出国女皇，丢失了一半灵魂呢。,"It seems that by witnessing something terrible, you have lost half of your soul. And you won't be able to remember who you are with only a few memories."
我不知道你是怎么飘到我这里来的，既然来了，不如就和我做个交易如何？我保证帮你找到失去的东西。,"I don't know how you got here. But since you are here, I can offer you a deal. I promise to help you restore your memories, but you must listen to me and do what I say. Do we have a deal?"
我……我答应你，反正现在的我，也没有什么可以失去的了。,I... Okay... I have nothing to lose anyway.
看来你对你当前的处境，还是相当了解呢。不过我先要测试测试你的实力。,But... I have to test your ability first. Come! I challenge you to a duel.
唔……看来你还没有忘记如何战斗。,Hmm... It seems your body still retains both its power and at least some of its skill.
我也不知道，只是感觉拿上了刀，身体就自己动起来了，就像是本能反应一样。,"I don't know how I did it. When I draw my blade out, my body just moves with it, like I have a natural fighting instinct."
我猜的不错，战斗的记忆依旧保存在你残缺的灵魂里，这样就好，至少我不用分心保护你了。,This is good. At least I don't have to worry about protecting you.
要找回你失去的另一半，首先得找到那些认识你的人，比如你曾经的子民，或者你的追随者。,"To find your lost soul, you must first find people you know, like the people you used to rule or the followers you once had."
总之，让我们先去你的家乡看看吧。,"Anyway, let's head to your hometown and see who we can find."
！！！,!!!
你，你们是什么人！,Who... who are you!?
冷静，猫又，我是潘多拉，我带了个人来见你。,"Calm down, Nekomata. I am Pandora. Look at who I brought."
你好，小姑娘……,"He...Hello, do you know me?"
！！！女皇大人！您是卑弥呼女皇大人！,!!! Queen Himiko!?
不可能的，卑弥呼大人早就辞世升天了，连本喵都只是在画像上见过，你是个冒牌货，吃我一爪！,It's impossible. Queen Himiko died a long time ago. You must be an imposter!
看起来得打一架了。,I think we have no choice but to show her the power and strength of Queen Himiko.
那把刀……就是传说中的天丛云剑喵？您真的是卑弥呼大人？,That blade... Is that the famous blade of Murakumo? So you really are Queen Himiko!?
我……我也不知道。,I... I don't know...
你的女皇大人失去了自己的过往，所以需要你们这些熟知她命运的人来告诉她，她究竟是个什么样的人。,"Your queen has almost entirely forgotten her past. To restore those memories, former subjects such as you must remind her of her former glory."
好了，我会把你们的记忆连接在一起，这样她就能从你的记忆里看到她原本的样子了……,"So, I will now connect your minds together. Then she can see who she is in your memories."
卑弥呼女皇大人是日出之地最伟大的女皇，是一位非常非常非常了不起的人喵！,"Queen Himiko is the greatest queen of our land, a wonderful queen that cares for her people!"
现在，你看到她认知中你的样子了，感觉怎么样？,"Now, seeing how she perceives you, how do you feel?"
我……我不知道，我还是不敢相信。,I... I don't know. I still can't believe that is me.
没关系，咱们先去看一样东西。,Give yourself some time. Let's head out to our next destination.
看看这阵风把咱们带到了哪。咦，这不是热田神宫嘛。,Look where we are! This is the Atsuta Shrine.
我认得这里，我曾经好像……是这里的管理者。,I... I think I know this place. I used to... be in charge here.
咱们进去看看。,Let's go inside.
站住！此乃御神器供奉之所，闲杂人等，不得靠近！,"Stop there! This is a sacred place, and thus a restricted area."
哎呀哎呀，别急，小丫头，你看看这是谁。,Look at this woman standing before you. Don't you recognize her?
卑弥……怎么可能？,"Queen Himi... No, it is impossible!"
你们居然敢冒充女皇大人，不可原谅！,You dare to pose as our beloved queen! This is unforgivable!
那段剑舞……是邪马台的古代舞蹈，你，你究竟是谁？,That blade technique... It's from the ancient Yamatai. Who are you?
那还用说吗？这位便是你们的女皇，卑弥呼大人。,"Isn't it obvious? This is your regent, Queen Himiko."
这怎么会，卑弥呼大人可是千年前的人，怎么会出现在这里。,How is this possible. She died thousands of years ago...
我作为传说中的魔女潘多拉，这不也活生生见到你面前了？,"Then how do you explain me? I, Pandora, a mythical being also stand before you."
好啦，不要再疑神疑鬼了，带我们进入神宫吧，咱们的女皇还有一段记忆要恢复呢。,"Your duty, first and foremost, is to serve your queen. Take us into the shrine. Your queen hopes that it might trigger more of her lost memories."
跟我来吧，我知道卑弥呼大人的八咫镜保存在什么地方。,Follow me. I know exactly what you need to see—the Yata no Kagami.
好了，让我们来看看，这面镜子，和这小丫头的脑袋里，有些什么关于你的记忆。,"Alright, let's see what this sacred mirror can do."
卑弥呼大人，是改变日出之国的人，是让我们走出岛屿，让世界都知道我们存在的人。,"Queen Himiko is the one who opened our small, isolated island to the wider world. She helped us grow and make new connections with other tribes."
我……我真的有做出这样的功绩吗？,I... I did all of this?
这面铜镜，是您的遗物，它记录了您生前的一切。,This mirror is your possession. It records your life.
尊贵的女皇陛下，请快一点，咱们该见下一位客人了。,"My dear queen, let's not waste time. We have another guest to see."
女皇大人，有个人听说您归来了，非要来见您，我就自作主张，把她带来了。,"Queen Himiko, someone has asked to see you."
我们又见面了，现世的女皇啊。,"Here we are again, Queen Himiko."
我记得你，你是……,I remember you! You are...
我是月夜见尊，月住之处的主神。,"I am Tsukuyomi, the moon god."
我……,I...
不必多说，我已经知晓了你等处境。我之所以在此，就是要将属于你的那份力量，奉还于你。,Say no more. I have already heard of your situation. I came because I want to give you my power to help you recover your memory. But...
我猜，您的馈赠，应该不是平白无故的吧。,But there is a price behind it?
没错，我需要你，卑弥呼，邪马台的女皇，继续履行你旧日的职责——镇压黄泉女神！,"Yes, I need you, Queen Himiko. I need you to perform your duty as a queen to beat Izanami. If she breaks free of her seal, people will suffer."
我明白，我已经隐约记起了我的职责所在。,I understand. I think my memory is gradually coming back...
很好，按照邪马台的传统，我会代替天照神给予你试炼，准备好了就来吧。,"Good, then, as part of the Yamatai tradition, I must give you a trial. Come when you are ready!"
你做的很好，这份力量归还给你了。,You did great. My power is now yours.
在你的人民的心目中，你就是母亲，你给他们带来和平，带来米粮，还有希望。,"In the eyes of your people, you are their great mother. You bring food, peace, and hope to the lands."
我……我辜负了我的子民，我将他们带上了战场，在战火中……燃烧殆尽。,"But... I failed them. I led them into war, and they all died because of me."
这是日出之国的命运。去吧，辉夜姬会给你最后的指引。,This is the fate of our people. There is nothing you can do to change it. I will call Princess Kaguya here. She will give you more guidance.
辉夜姬，把那块勾玉带上来。,"Princess Kaguya, bring that Magatama up here."
谨遵阁下之命。,"Yes, my lord."
这块八尺琼勾玉，上面残留着你的信念，卑弥呼，你就凭你的实力赢取它吧。,"This precious jade artifact, the Yasakani no Magatama, stores part of your spirit. As you may recall, you must fight for it."
那就得罪了，辉夜姬。,"Then, bring it, Princess Kaguya."
请务必倾尽实力，卑弥呼大人。,I'd be honored to fight you!
卑弥呼大人的力量，果然名不虚传，勾玉现在也算物归原主了。,Our dear queen really lives up to her reputation. What power!
子民们称你为太阳的女儿，天照神的化身，因你炽热的信念，是指引他们战斗的信心。,Your people call you the daughter of the sun because your faith is like fire. I now see why. It is inspiring.
我的……信念。我想我知道以前的我，是个什么样的人了。,My faith...I used to have that kind of faith? I vaguely remember...
很好，继续前进吧，去追寻你的宿命。,"Good, let's keep moving. Your fate awaits."
哎哟，看看这是谁来了。,"Oh, look who is there."
巴里？抱歉，我们的行程里好像没有和你会面的计划。,Bari? I don't remember planning this meeting
但我还是来了。,But here I am!
我建议你，哪凉快哪待着去！,I strongly suggest you step aside and don't bother us.
潘多拉，这里交给我吧。,"Pandora, let me handle this."
遵命，我的女皇大人。,"Alright, my dear queen."
巴里，我听说过你的事迹，你挡在我的必经之路上，意为何事？,"Princess Bari, I have heard a lot about you. Why are you here?"
有人拉我入伙，想让我干掉你。但我有个新主意。,Someone asked me to defeat you. But I have a proposal for you.
新主意？说实话我挺有兴趣的。,What is it?
不如你们和我打一场，打赢了我，我就“被迫”向你们透露点信息。如果输了的话，您恐怕就得跟我走了。,"Let's fight. If you win, then I will have to tell you the truth about who sent me.. But if you lose, you have to come with me."
求之不得，来吧！,That sounds fair. Let's do it!
啊……你居然寻回了三神器？,What? That blade... the sacred mirror and the jade artifact... How did you manage to find these three artifacts?
承认吧，你不是我的对手。,Just admit it. You are no match for me.
呼……好吧，这次算你赢，我期待着再次和你决战！,"Fine, you win. But I will not stop challenging you in the future!"
好啦，亲爱的，你答应过我们，要“被迫”透露一点信息的，是时候兑现你的承诺了。,"Now, darling, you promised. You must tell the truth. Who is behind this and why?"
黄泉女神，伊邪那美回归了，她正在酝酿着降临现世的计划。,Izanami sent me. She is planning her return.
我担心的事情，终于还是发生了……,I knew it! Why can't she stop coming back?
放心吧，我会封印她，就像过去一样！,"Relax, I will defeat her and seal her away, just as I have done in the past."
天呐，不是吧，真是哪里有麻烦哪里就有她。,Oh my gosh! Why do I keep running into you?
你们的路到头了，离开，或者死亡！,"The road you are on ends here. Leave, or die!"
巨龙，我手中的刀，斩杀过你无数的同类，在它的面前，你毫无胜算！,This blade I hold has killed many dragons. You stand no chance against me.
那就试试吧，让我看看这把传说中的神剑，究竟是不是徒有虚名！,Then try. Let's see if that blade is as mighty as you say.
看来你比我想象中难对付得多！,You are much tougher than I thought.
哼，彼此彼此，这场对决确实让我热血沸腾。,And your technique with that blade really impressed me.
你赢得了我的尊敬，不介意的话，我愿指引你梦境中接下来的方向。,"You have won my respect. If you don't mind, let's team up, and I will help you to get out of this place."
啊，一份可口的晚餐……,"Ah, what have I found here? A delicious dinner."
阿佩普？作为埃及毁灭之神，为什么会跑到这里来？,Apep? Why are you here? What evil plot are you a part of this time?
伊邪那美向我许诺，会将整个黄泉比良坂的灵魂都交予我掌控，只要我能帮助她降临。,Shush! Don't cut me off. I am here becasue Izanami promised to let me take charge of all souls in this land if I helped her.
她不会得逞的，而你恐怕也无法阻拦我。,"She will not succeed, and I am afraid you are no match for me either."
我很乐意赌一把试试看。,I am willing to take the chance.
她消失了？看来这不是她的本体，只是个分身而已。,Did she just disappear? It seems like she was just an illusion.
我已经感受到了伊邪那美的气息，古老而深邃……走吧，我们要赶在她降临之前阻止她。,I sense that Izanami is about to come. Let's hurry up. We have to stop her before it is too late.
月读，我的女儿……,"Tsukuyomi, my beautiful girl..."
很久都没有见你了呢……那时你和天照刚诞生不久……,I haven't seen you for a long time...
不要妄图蛊惑我，你不是我母亲，她已经死了，你只是有着她面容的可憎幻影！,Don't try to trick me. You are no mother to me. My mother is dead.
而你，卑弥呼……,"And you, Himiko..."
你不愧为天照亲手创造的复制品，你的每一个动作，都和她一模一样。,"As the creation of Amaterasu, you are just like her, so irrational."
我已经取回了三神器，我会再次将你封印，一如既往！,"I have collected the three artifacts, and I will use them to seal your power!"
来吧，让你们感受我这千万年的怨恨，和……恐惧……,"I dare you to try! I spent all these years in darkness, and no one cared about how I felt. You shall feel my wrath!"
我不会消失，我将永远存在，只要世上还有怨恨，我就会存在……,I will not disappear as long as there is hatred in the world!
……她说得没错，她不会被真正的消灭，只要人世还存在恩怨情仇，她就还会回来。,……She is right. She will not be destroyed completely. One day she will return.
这大概就是我被召回人世的原因。,I think that's why I came back to life.
我的身体……似乎正在消失，我到底怎么了？为什么会这样？,My body.... feels different... What is happening?
伊邪娜美消失的地方，好像残留着什么！,Something emerged from Izanami's body...
卑弥呼，我来找你了。,"Himiko, I am coming for you!"
你……你浑身充满恶念，你究竟是……,You... who are you?
我是你丢失的那一半，我是你内心深处黑暗渴望，我就是你，带领你的子民走向毁灭之人。,"I am the other half of your soul, your darkest desires come to life. I am the one who leads our people to ruin."
不，我不信，你不可能是我，我不会有你身上那种邪恶。,No! I don't believe it. You can't be me.
不管你信不信，我就是你，是你摒弃的那一半，只有拥抱我，你才能会变成完整的存在。,"Whether you believe me or not, I am the part of you that you so often cast aside. Only when you embrace me will you become whole."
我会终结这个轮回，与你共赴黄泉！,I will not accept this!
我会与你同归于尽！,I will end this and perish with you.
看来这是我们的天命……,"This is our destiny, and there is no way to escape it."
也许你是对的，没人能摒弃自己的另一面活着。我接受你。,I accept you...
来吧，我等这一天已经很久了。,Come. I've been waiting a long time for this day.
你不能这样做！如果你离开了，将无人守护日出之国！,"You can't do this! If you leave, there will be no one to protect our land!"
月读阁下，没有权力会有永恒，但始终会有人继承我的信念……,"Tsukuyomi, no power will last forever. Someday, someone else will assume my responsibility."
真是让人费解，在我看来，如同日月一样，人都有自己黑暗的另一面，没有人可以舍弃。,"No one can shed their dark side. They are bound together, just like the sun and moon."
她消失了，现在怎么办？,She just disappeared. Now what?
不，她只是脱离了这场梦境的轮回，看来她最终寻找到了自己存在的价值。,"No, she has just left this dreamland. I think she finally knows what needs to be done."
而我们要做的，只是祈祷她经历这场梦境后，能够在现实世界坚持自己的信念而已。,And the only thing we can do is pray that she will continue to adhere to her faith back in the real world.
祝她好运吧，我们也应该离开了。,Wish her luck.

这里是什么地方？我明明是在彩虹桥口，为什么突然到这里来了？,What is this place? I thought I was guarding the Rainbow Bridge leading to Asgard. Why am I here?
你的身体依旧还守在彩虹桥上，只是你的意识被彩虹桥送到了这里。,"Your body is still there, but your mind has made its way to this place."
所以，你来此有何贵干？换句话说，你在寻找什么？海姆达尔，阿斯加德仙宫的守望者。,"So, Heimdall, what draws you to my dreamland? Or should I ask, what is the guard of the Rainbow Bridge searching for?"
我，我看到了诸神的黄昏……,"As I was drifting off to sleep, I was thinking about Ragnarok, and the death of all gods."
在那一天，所有的神族的敌人都冲上了彩虹桥，和我们展开决战，最后……,It's foretold that our enemies will rush the Rainbow Bridge on that day. It's the scene of the final fight...
我们的世界在火巨人苏特尔的剑下，化为了灰烬。,"In the end, our home will be burnt to ashes by the sword of Surtr, the Fire Giant."
所以你才想寻遍九界，寻找破解你们族人命运的方法。,So you are looking for a way to stop this from happening?
或许这是既定的命运呢？或许这是无法改变的未来呢？,Perhaps fate can't be changed?
我相信一定有办法可以挽救阿斯加德，即便那是命运，我也要将它打碎！,There must be a way to save Asgard. I can't stand to see it destroyed.
很好。我是潘多拉，就我先试试你的力量，看你有没有资格担当这份重任。,"Well, then, you have come to the right place! I can help you with that. I am Pandora, the creator of this dreamland. But first, I must test you to see if you're strong enough to survive the journey."
不错，仙宫的守望者，果然名不虚传。,"Hmm, not bad. Your reputation as the guardian of Asgard is well merited."
跟我走吧，我这前段日子刚好来了位客人，她也许能给你解答。,Follow me. I may know someone here who has a solution to your problem.
蜂蜜蜂蜜，哪里有蜂……找到你就吃顿饱，哼~哼~,Where is my honey? I was promised lots of honey!
啊……你是谁？我可没记着邀请过你这号人物来我这做客，我的客人呢，在哪？,Who are you??? I don't remember inviting you here. And where is my guest? I invited Belldandy to join us.
啊这，这难道不是洛基的花园吗？是她邀请我过来的，说藏着几罐好蜜，送给我吃。,"Eh? I thought this garden belongs to Loki. She invited me here, promising plenty of honey."
洛基？她在这里？这是她的作风。,Loki? Is she here? It was a probably a trick. This is what Loki likes to do.
怎么，她是你朋友？,Is she your friend?
不，她是我的敌人……最大的敌人！,"No, she is my enemy... The greatest one!"
看来，咱们要找的人一定是被她藏起来了，咱们只能先找到她。,I see. I see. It seems that Loki has kidnapped the person we're looking for. Let's go find her.
喂，你们到底想怎么样啊，突然出现还吵吵闹闹的，让我怎么吃饭啊？,"Stop making so much noise, and give me the honey I was promised!"
说了多少遍了这是我的地盘！该离开的是你才对。,This is my garden. And I never promised you any honey.
告诉我洛基她现在在哪？,You need to tell us where Loki is now.
哼哼！有本事就来打一架，只要你们打得赢我，我就告诉你们。,"Humph! You expect me to answer your questions when you won't give me any honey? Defeat me in combat, if you have the courage, and maybe I'll tell you where she is."
哇！,Uwah! (Crying)
她……她哭了，是我下手太重了吗？,She... she crying. Did I go too far?
放心吧，她这身熊皮厚着呢，你刚才那几下，也就给她造成了点皮外伤。,Don't worry. Her bearskin is thick and strong. Those wounds will be gone within a day or two.
好了，别哭了，打之前你说什么来着？,"Stop your crying! *sigh* And you think we lack courage? Hmph! Now tell us, where is Loki?"
我知道了，我这就带你们去找她，哼哼！,"Alright, alright. I will take you to her!"
到啦，就是这里。,This is it. We are here.
你们看，那个站在楼顶上的人，就是她。,See that shadow standing there? It's Loki.
洛基！洛基！我在这！这里有人在找你！,"Loki! Loki! It's me, Ungnyeo. There's someone here to see you."
那不是洛基，那是个女武神。,She is not Loki. The angel standing here is Valkyrie.
你们是什么人？咦，海姆达尔？,Who are you? And why is Heimdall here?
瓦尔基里，你在这里干什么？,"I have the same question for you, Valkyrie."
不对，你们一定是她创造出的幻象。给我现出原型吧！,You must be an illusion created by Loki! Show me who you really are!
现在你清醒了？好好看看，我们究竟是不是幻象。,We are not illusions. Do you believe your eyes now?
你确实是真正的海姆达尔……我还以为你是洛基创造出来的幻象。,I thought Loki was trying to trick me again.
说说，你为什么会在这里？,"So tell me, why are you here?"
洛基骗了我，让我在这里寻找我姐妹们的踪迹，然后又派来一波波幻象怪物偷袭，想要除掉我。,"Loki deceived me! She said I could find clues here about where my sisters had gone. Since I arrived, she's sent waves of monsters and illusions to attack me."
你知道她朝哪个方向去了吗？,Do you know where she was headed?
我知道，你们跟我来吧。,Yes. Follow me.
不许动！,Stop there!
希芙？,Sif?
哦呀？我不认识你，你怎么会知道我的名字？,Oh? Who are you? Why do you know my name?
我是海姆达尔，这是瓦尔基里，你不认识我们了？,"I am Heimdall, and this is Valkyrie. Don't you remember us?"
我好像不认识什么海姆达尔，把我的头发还给我吧，我就放你们走。,"I don't know anyone by that name. But if you give back my hair, I will let you pass."
头发？什么头发？,Hair? What are you talking about?
哇哦，你看她的头发，好像被人剪了一大截，简直就像小羊啃过的草坪。,"Wow, what happened to her hair? It looks like a lawn eaten by a flock of hungry sheep."
一定又是洛基干的好事！,That must be Loki's doing!
希芙，我们好好谈谈，可以吗？你以前可是一位温柔的人。,"Sif, can you tell us what happened?"
废话少说！如果不交出我的头发，我就从你们头上拔，直到我满意为止。,"Cut your nonsense. If you don't give back my hair, then I will take yours instead."
我的头……好痛，我这是在哪？海姆达尔？瓦尔基里？你们怎么在这里？,My head... where has my beautiful hair gone?! Heimdall and Valkyrie? What are you doing here?
这也是我想问的话，希芙，你是怎么来到这个地方的？,"It's a long story. Let's not talk about this now. Why are you here, Sif?"
洛基，这个家伙偷走了我的头发，还用魔法迷惑了我。,"Loki, that horrible piece of sh-. She took my hair and bewildered me with her magic!"
姐妹们，帮我打败洛基，抢回我的头发。,"Sisters, I need to find her and get my hair back!"
那正好，我们也在找她，就劳烦你带路吧。,"Good, we are also looking for her. Come, follow us."
哇！好大的一片花园呀，这里一定有不少蜜蜂！小蜜蜂啊小蜜蜂，哼哼……,Wow! What a big garden. There must be lots of bees and honey...
哎呀，这是芙蕾雅的榭寄生花园，她怎么也在这里？,This must be Freyja's Secret Garden. What is she doing here?
你们是谁，竟敢闯入我的花园！,Who dares to enter my garden?
芙蕾雅，我是海姆达尔……你忠实的姐妹。,"Freyja! It's your sister, Heimdall."
你就是那个害死我的孩子巴德尔的人？,"Heimdall? You were the one who strangled my son, Baldr!"
你也被魔法迷惑了吗？可恶的洛基！,I am no killer... Wait. Are you also bewildered by Loki's magic?
等等，我这是在哪？你们是谁？呀！！,Wait... Who am I? Where am I...
哎呀，我……我都说了些什么呀，有没有不小心说出有失礼节的话呢？,I... What did I say...
芙蕾雅，你的举止一直优雅绝伦，即便受到了洛基迷惑。究竟发生了什么？,"Freyja, don't worry. Everything is fine."
我在追踪她的过程中了她的魔法，她突然转身对我邪魅一笑，我迷迷糊糊就来到了这里。,"I was tracking her, and I was so close to catching her... I remember she turned around and smiled at me. And then... That's all I can remember."
如果你们正在找洛基，请带上我，我嘛，要好好教育教育……这个调皮的小坏蛋。,"If you are looking for Loki, take me with you. I need to teach her a lesson!"
有了你的帮助，我们会更加强大，姐妹。,"With your help, we will have a better chance of beating her."
这是……耶梦加得之台。,This looks like the realm of the Midgard Serpent.
这不是耶梦加得之台，只不过是洛基那拙劣的幻象而已。,"No, that's also an illusion created by Loki."
哎呀，来了群稀客呢。,What a pleasant surprise.
这都是些什么阿猫阿狗……我真是越来越搞不明白了，这到底是我的梦境领域，还是洛基的……,Who are you??? I am so confused. Is this my dreamland or Loki's?
我在九界中看到过你的模样，你是美杜莎，蛇发女妖，石之国的女王！,"I have seen you before. You are Medusa, one of the three Gorgon sisters."
看来洛基说的没错，这个世界上，还真没有你海姆达尔不知晓的事情呢。,It looks like Loki was right about you. There is nothing you don't know...
你这么聪明，不如你猜猜，我在这里干什么。,"Since you are so smart, why don't you guess what I'm doing here?"
洛基一定许诺将耶梦加得的力量赐予你，然后你就借着这个力量，回去找雅典娜复仇。,"Loki must have promised you the power of the Midgard Serpent, and with that power, you plan to beat Athena."
哎呀呀，不得不说，你洞察人心的能力，还真是……嗯，别具一格。,I'm impressed!
洛基从来都不会履行自己的承诺，你被她骗了。,You should know that Loki never honors her commitments. She lied to you.
那就让我们拭目以待吧。,Is that right? Or do you just want me to tell you where she is? Take this!
这儿不属于你，离开吧，回到你的世界去！,This is not your world. Leave now!
洛基这家伙，真是越来越胆大妄为了，居然联合其他国度的神来对付我们。,"Loki, that audacious swindler... She managed to pull in helpers from another realm!"
没关系，希芙，我们会抓到她的，到时候再把她锁起来，好好教育教育她阿斯加德的礼仪。,"Don't worry, Sif. We will catch her and lock her in the dungeon of Asgard."
约顿海姆？我们怎么到了冰霜巨人的国度？潘多拉，这是怎么回事？我还在你的梦境里吗？,"Why are we in the land of Frost Giants? Pandora, what happened? Are we still in your dreamland?"
当然还在，这个世界显然不是我制造出来的，是你们那位叫做洛基的朋友。,"Yes, but I didn't create this place. Loki did."
我能感受到她的气息，洛基……,I think she's nearby...
难道你们不知道，未经许可造访他人宅邸是一件失礼的事情吗？我可不记得有给你们发邀请函。,Don't you know that you are all trespassing? I don't remember inviting any of you here.
一头冰龙？你该不会是想把这儿当巢穴了吧？真是的……这可是我大名鼎鼎的魔女潘多拉的地盘！,An ice dragon? Do you take this as your home? This is my place.
潘多拉？呵呵呵呵，就是那个连自己盒子里装的什么都不知道的笨蛋？,Pandora? If it isn't the stupid angel that doesn't even know what's in her magical little box.
居然敢说我是笨蛋？海姆达尔，干掉这只小蜥蜴，我就带你去找洛基。,"How dare you call me stupid! Heimdall, let's kill that annoying little lizard."
可恶！这次算你们人多，下次我会在你落单的时候，来和你一战。我记住了你们了！,Damn! There are so many of you. That wasn't a fair fight! I will come after you when you are alone.
可算是走了，我可不喜欢家里来太多奇奇怪怪的客人，弄得一团糟。,Finally! She left. Look what a mess she made to my dreamland!
欢迎各位来到我的剧场，接下来我将为各位带来阿斯加德最凄美，最壮烈的史诗巨作——巴德尔的葬礼！,Welcome to my theater! Now I will present the most magnificent masterpiece——Baldr's funeral!
是奥丁，她怎么会在这儿？,Is that Odin? What's she doing here?
奥丁？不，这可不是奥丁，这是洛基。我隔这么远都能闻到她身上的那股邪魔外道的气息。,"Odin? No, you're Loki! I can even smell the vileness of this place! Only she would treat my son's death like a twisted joke."
洛基，你骗不了我们！,"Loki, you can not trick us!"
我乃独眼之奥丁！我要好好教训一下你们，让你们明白你们该尊敬谁！,"I am Odin, the Queen of Asgard. You dare to question my authority?"
消失了……,She disappeared...
哼，本来就是洛基的幻影。,I told you she was Loki in disguise.
姐妹们，洛基就在这不远了，我能感受到她。,"Sisters, Loki is around. Be careful."
嘻嘻嘻，看看我是谁。,"Hehe, look who I am."
可恶，居然变成我的样子来愚弄我，真是不可饶恕！,How dare you pretend to be me?
洛基，你把我的客人——命运女神，弄到哪去了？,"Loki, what have you done to my guest?"
别急，魔女，我只不过变成了你的样子，暂时把她骗到一旁欣赏风景去了。,"Oh, do you mean Belldandy? Don't worry. I tricked her and led her somewhere else. She's safe there."
她在哪？快把她变回来！,Where is she?
哎呀哎呀，我那野蛮粗暴的海姆达尔，你又要动不动就对我挥动武器了吗？大可不必大可不必。,"Don't be so rude, Heimdall."
你不是想要知道破解诸神黄昏的方法吗？来吧，让我开心一下，或许我就会告诉你。,"Don't you want to know how to avoid Ragnarok? Let's play a game, and then maybe I'll tell you how."
既然你那么想挨揍，那么这一次也让你如愿。,"Since you're so desperate for a fight, I'll give you one."
怎么样，和镜子里的自己打架，是不是很好玩呢？,Is it fun to fight yourself?
快变回你自己的样子，否则我就再打你一顿！,"Change back to your true form, or I will beat you again."
不不不，我才刚喜欢上你的样子呢……至少让我再快乐一阵子。,I just fell in love with your look. At least let me use it for a while.
随便你，快把命运女神交出来。,Ugh... Whatever! Tell us where Belldandy is!
糟糕，我也不记得把她藏在哪了，是北边那个洞呢，还是西边那个……,"Oh damn, I don't remember where I hid her. Was it the mountains in the North or the forest to the West..."
休想再愚弄我，狡猾的家伙！,Stop playing us! You filthy trickster!
停停停停！你就不想听听破解诸神黄昏的方法吗？我可是知道的哟。,"Okay, okay. Do you want to know how to avoid Ragnarok? I can tell you."
你说的话我一个字也不信，把女神交出来，然后你就可以离开了。,I don't trust a word coming from your mouth. Tell us where Belldandy is!
好好好，这可是你自己要见她的啊。哎呀呀，有人想和命运打交道呢，真是难以置信。,"Alright, alright. But remember, you asked to see the goddess of fate yourself. No one forced that on you."
好了，命运女神来了，你自己和她玩吧，我就不在这里扫兴了。,"Well, there she is. I'm leaving now. Until next time."
那你告诉我，如何才能拯救阿斯加德？,Oh? How?
你把耳朵靠过来，我只说给你一个人听。,"Come closer, I will only tell this to you."
我知道了。,"Okay, I get it."
姐妹们，返回阿斯加德吧，我知道如何拯救我们的国度了。,"Sisters, let's go back to Asgard. I know how to save our world."
不，不对劲，洛基和你说了些什么？,What did Loki tell you?
这是……秘密。,It's... a secret between us.
命运之轮，转动不止，它揭示一切，以及你的到来。你不必开口，我以及知晓了你的疑问。,"The wheel of destiny turns round and round like a spindle. It reveals everything, including your arrival. You don't have to speak. I know why you are here."
那么请告诉我破解诸神黄昏，解救阿斯加德的方法。,"Then, please tell me how to save Asgard from Ragnarok."
命运之所以是命运，是因为它本身就是注定会发生的，它本身就是在未来发生过的事实。,Fate is absolute and immutable. That is why it is called fate.
命运，无法改变。,So it is unchangeable.
如果我偏要修改这段命运呢？,What if I have to change it?
我会阻止你……,"As the goddess of fate, I will stop you..."
住手！修改命运，会带来无法预计的后果，有可能会为所有世界都带来毁灭！,"Stop! If you change fate, the consequences will be devasting. The world will be destroyed!"
我的家园都没了，我还需要诸界干什么？,Why should I care about the rest of the world if I've lost my homeland?
如今我终于看到了命运修改后的世界……诸神黄昏危机解除了……等等！那是什么？！,I... I can see what happens if I change the world's fate... There will be no Ragnarok... Wait! What is that?
一个巨大的黑影遮住的世界……那是什么，我看不清，洪水……冰川，整个世界都陷入了冰冻。,"A giant shadow is covering the world... What is that? I can't see through it... Wait, it is ice... The world is frozen!"
你看到了吗，这就是命运被改变后的世界。,Now you see what the world would be like if you changed your fate.
难道真的……没有办法了吗？,Are there any other ways?
女孩，家园从来不是一个地方，只要你们还有血脉尚存，就会有未来。,"My girl, nothing can destroy your homeland, including Ragnarok. As long as your people survive, there is always a chance to rebuild."
我明白了，女神。,"I understand. Thank you, Belldandy."
怎么说？就这么……结束了？,So what happened? Is it over?
结束了。接下来我会回到彩虹桥，去迎接诸神黄昏的到来，以及……将我们的知识与文明，传承下去。,It is over. I will return to my station to face fate. I will try to pass down our knowledge and culture to my people so that Asgard will be reborn one day.

我接待过不少客人，但像你这样从天上掉下来的，还真是罕见呢。,"I have met many angels who accidentally came here, none of them fell from the sky like you."
你是谁？这是什么地方？我这是怎么了？,Who are you? What is this place?
是的，巨龙，每个来我这的，都问过一模一样的问题。,"Yeah, yeah. I am tired of answering the same question again and again."
我是潘多拉，秘密与探究之神，这是我的梦境，在这里，你尽情追求你想要的。,"I'll only say this once, so listen carefully. I am Pandora, the goddess of mystery. This is my dreamland where you can get what you desire the most."
我……我想找回我失去的力量，重新飞向那片天空。,I... I want to recover my lost power and be able to fly again.
来我这试图寻找力量的神可不少，你得先过我这关，让我评估评估你有没有这个资格。,"I am not surprised. Plenty of angels came here for power. But before you continue your quest, I have a test for you."
这就是风暴巨龙的力量吗？看来你还有点厉害，即便是在这样虚弱的情况下。,"Hmm, this is the power of the storm. It is strong and overpowering."
这样是不是就代表我够格了？,Does this mean I passed your test?
唔，至少不会被一下子击溃了。咳咳，我可是对你留手了哦。,"Ye...Yes... But remember, I went easy on you this time."
我感受到了……风的气息。,The wind is telling me someone is nearby...
喵！,Meow!
一只猫？,A cat?
喵！本喵才不是普通的猫！本喵可是大名鼎鼎的猫又！,"I am not just a cat, Meow! I am the Nekomata!"
你身上有我正在寻找的风之力，请把它交给我。,I think you have the power of the wind that I am looking for. Hand that to me now if you know what's good for you.
喵？你要这颗珠子？这可是本喵好不容易得来的，哪有你说给你就给你的啊？,"Do you mean that Bead of the Wind? No, I will not give you that! That's my precious."
这是你无法掌控的力量，只有风暴龙族才能使用。,This bead contains power you can't control. Only the dragon of the storm can use it to its fullest potential.
那就过来抢啊喵！你打得过我我就把它交给你喵！,"Humph, I don't believe you. If you want it, come and get it yourself."
呼……呼……别打了别打了，本喵认输。,Sto...stop (breathing heavily). I yield!
给，这是你要的风之宝珠，喵。,Take this Bead of the Wind.
我感觉力量得到了恢复……虽然只有一部分。,I think my power is partly restored...
你太虚弱了，也许还需要继续寻找更多力量，才能让你获得重回天空的机会。,This won't give you enough power to fly again. Let's find the rest of them.
那就请继续带路吧，潘多拉。,Lead the way.
等一下喵！你们要去冒险吗？请带上本喵！本喵会在路上给你们不少帮助的喵！,"Wait, are you going on an adventure? Please take me with you!"
看来也是个渴求力量的宝宝呢，那就跟上吧。,Just stop crawling all over me and get off me!
喵！前面的那个家伙好像在吃东西，不如我们趁她不注意……,Meow! I think someone over there is eating something... Let's ambush her!
我感受到了，她身上有我在寻找的雷霆之力。,I can feel the thunder power that I am looking for.
……有股触电的感觉，麻麻的。,"……Hmm, why is my skin tingling?"
哎？！你们，你们是从哪里冒出来的？,What!? Where did you come from?
你身上带着雷霆之力感应到了我的存在。,You have one of my Beads of power. That's how I found you.
哼哼，在我的地方偷吃了这么多，是该还一点回来了。,Why are you always eating when I meet you? Do you know you have devoured all the honey in my dreamland?
你们是来抢我的蜂蜜的吗？,Are you here to take my honey from me?
我们……算了算了，你手里那个带电的罐子，对，就是装蜂蜜的那个，拿来给我们。,"We are not... Never mind. Hand me that jar that's creating sparks in the air. Yes, that one with honey in it."
想得美！,Over my dead body!
我，我不明白……你，你们干嘛非要这个罐子不可。,"I, I don't understand... Why do you want that jar?"
这个罐子，是过去用来储存雷电的容器，叫做雷霆圣杯，我需要它上面残留的雷霆之力。,"This jar is used to store thunder, it is called Thunder Grail. I need its power."
原来是这样，我说怎么老有股麻麻的触电感觉，等我把里面的蜂蜜吃完就给你。,"That's what it is... No wonder why I sometimes felt like lightning was hitting me. Wait a second. Let me finish the rest of the honey, and I will give it back to you. Here."
我能感受到，雷电的力量正在涌入我的身体。,I can feel the power of thunder rumbling through my body.
你变强了很多。,You have grown much stronger.
但这还不够，我还需要更多。,But this is not enough...
你们是要去找好吃的吗？请带上我一个！,Are you going to find delicious food to eat?
吃的？你脑子里除了吃还有其他东西吗？,Is there anything else you care about beside food?
呵呵，据说，雨水是天下最纯净的水，如果用它来煮茶，一定能煮出绝佳的风味……,It is said that rain is the purest water and that it makes the best tea.
所以这就是你占有雨水之力的原因？,That's why you took my power of rain as your own?
不对不对，我可没“占有”它，我只是找一个自称“日出处女王”的家伙那取来的。,"I didn't steal that. I took part of it from the Queen of Yamatai, Himiko."
她在哪？带我去见她。,Where is she? Please take me to her.
那可不行，她可是我重要的合作伙伴……除非你能打赢我，证明你有能力取代她的位置。,"What? No, I will not betray her. She is an important ally. Unless... you prove your worth by defeating me."
你输了，现在你可以带我们去见她了。,You lost. Now take us to her.
好吧好吧，我带你去见她……真是不识雅性呢。,"Well, well, well... What's the rush?"
这是……,Where am I...
哎呀，一不小心，迷路了呢……,"Alas, I accidentally got lost..."
尊客，在下记得没有邀请过诸位来到在下的领域……诸位来此是有何见教吗？,I don't remember inviting any of you here... What do you want from me?
抱歉，我们只是路过……,I am sorry. We are just passing by...
你身上，散发着强者的气息呢。,You are strong...
哦？龙神大人，您似乎在追求着什么。,Hmm? What? Are you interested in fighting me?
力量……以及强大的对手。,"Yes, you are a good opponent."
等等，你不会是想和她打吧？,Wait! Why don't you all calm down?
既然龙神大人有意，在下不介意与您比试比试。,Not if she insists..
在下输了，龙神大人，真的是武力充沛呢。,I lost. You are indeed powerful...
与其认输，不如跟着我，和我一同寻找力量吧。,"Why don't you follow me, and we can become more powerful together?"
这要求会不会显得有些失礼？,What? It isn't polite to say that bluntly.
无妨，在下将辅佐龙神大人布武世间。,There is no need to be subtle about that. I accept your offer.
呼……找到了，这就是你要追寻的雨水之力所有者。,Finally... we are here!
吾乃日出之国的女皇，汝等是何人……月神大人，您怎么……,"I am the Queen of Yamatai. Who are you? Goddess of the moon, why are you with them?"
在下答应龙神大人要助她寻回昔日力量。,I promised to help Storm Dragon take back her power.
卑弥呼，你持有求雨之盘，那么在下将不得不与你为敌了。,"Himiko, you have the Plate of Rain. It contains the power of the rain."
这盘子，对吾，对吾之子民，有着大用，恕吾不能交与汝等。,This plate means a lot to my people. I can't give that to you.
看来这份力量，始终不属于吾。,It seems this power doesn't serve me after all...
即便你得到了，也无法使用它，倒不如还给我，等我力量恢复，就为你的国家带去风调雨顺。,"Even if you own it, you can't make full use of it. But if you give it back to me, I will use it to bestow favorable weather to your land once my power is restored"
是真的吗？,Really?
既然如此，吾便追随在汝左右，亲眼见证这一刻的到来。,"Then, I will help you to recover it."
你已经恢复了风、雷、雨的力量了，风暴之龙，下一步你准备要做什么？,"So, we have the wind, the thunder, and the rain... What's next?"
按照我族的传统，应该行飞升之礼了。要飞升，必须得到西王母的试炼……,"By tradition, we must undergo the Trial of Ascension? To start the trial, we must first pay a visit to Xiwangmu."
西王母？那可巧得很呢，我刚好知道她在哪，就让我带你去吧。,Xiwangmu? I happen to know where she is. Let me take you to her.
你们似乎迷路了呢，居然来到这彼岸之地……,You seem lost...
别怪我没提醒你们，在这里待久了，可就回不去了哦。,"I need to remind you. This is no place for fun and games. If you stay here for a long time, you will not be able to return to the world of living."
母神大人，别来无恙啊。,"Izanami, how have you been?"
是月读吗？好一阵子没见，你越长越美了呢。所以你们来这黄泉彼岸有什么事情？,Tsukuyomi? Long time no see. You look more beautiful than ever. What are you doing here?
我要觐见西王母，准备行飞升之礼。,I am going to meet Xiwangmu and start the Trial of Ascending.
哦呵呵呵，原来是有一条小龙准备飞升啊……不对，你已经是一头成熟巨龙了。,"Hmm, a grown-up dragon wanting to start the Trial..."
我猜，你一定是失去力量了，想靠着飞升重获过去的力量。,You must hope to regain your power by passing the trial. Am I right?
怎么，你想拦住我飞升的脚步吗？,Do you want to stop me?
像你这种失去力量重新飞升的龙可不多见，史上仅有的几例都在飞升时得到了晋阶。,"It's rare for a dragon to lose her power, yet come prepared for the Trial of Ascension so quickly."
如果在你飞升之前，夺取你的力量，一定会让我变得更加强大，这可是难得的机会。,"If I take your power before that trial, I would become more powerful than ever."
那就要看你有没有这个能力了，哼！,"Well, try me."
看来我低估了你。,It seems that I have underestimated your power.
好吧，既然你过了我这关，那就顺着这条冥河而上吧，你会找到想见之人的。,"If you want to start your trial, follow the river to the end. And you will find Xiwangmu there."
母神大人，请保重。,"Take care, Izanami."
去吧，呵呵，下次见到天照，记得让她别那么恨我了。,"Go, and say hello to Amaterasu for me if you meet her."
风暴之龙，王母命我在这里等候你们。,"Storm Dragon, Xiwangmu told me to wait for you here."
我听说过你，嫦娥仙子，月宫的守望者，你就是我的第二场试炼吗？,"I have heard of you, the goddess living in the moon palace. Are you here to test me?"
是的，只有通过我的考验，你才能见到王母。,"Yes, if you want to meet her, you must defeat me first."
那就让我们开始吧。,Then let the battle begin.
纯净的月光，照亮了你的内心，让我看到了你的坚定。,I can sense your determination through the moonlight.
仙子，能和你打上一场，是我的荣幸。,It's my honor to fight with you.
呵呵，来吧，我这就带你们去见王母。,Come. I will take you to Xiwangmu.
王母，我已经按照您的吩咐，将风暴之龙带来了。,"Wangmu, Storm Dragon is here."
你可以去歇息了，嫦娥仙子，接下来的事就让我来吧。,You may rest now. I will take it from here.
王母，我已经准备好开始飞升仪式了。,"Wangmu, I am ready to take the trial."
很好，风暴之龙，那就上前来吧。,"Very well, Storm Dragon. Come closer."
我身后这扇大门，便是巨龙飞升的地方，你如果能击败我，飞入门中，就能完成仪式。,"This door behind me is where a dragon begins its flight. If you defeat me, you can pass the trial and fly through the door."
那我们开始吧。,Let's get started.
我做到了，我通过了你的考验。,I did it! I passed the trial.
没错，你越过了龙门，你可以开始你的飞升之路了。,"Yes, you have proven your power."
但我这里还有一个晋阶的机会，看你愿不愿意冒这个风险了。,But I have another opportunity for you to move further. Are you willing to take a risk?
追逐力量，击败强敌，是我毕生所求，我接受这个挑战！,I accept your challenge!
这个晋升机会只有一个，你需要与另外一位前来寻求晋升的强者一同争夺这个机会。,This opportunity is only available to a strong dragon. You will be competing against another of your kind.
而这个强者，我想你应该挺熟的……,I think you know who she is...
能够重回天空，我已经满足了。,I'm not interested.
既然如此，那你就继续踏上飞升之路吧。,"Hmm, then go. It is time for the dragon to return to the sky!"
我带来了你的毁灭，风暴族裔！,"I will bring about your demise, my dear Storm Dragon."
许久不见，你还是这么爱吹嘘。你引以为豪的双翼，在我看来，就像羊皮纸一样薄弱。,"I haven't seen you for a long time. You still love to boast. To me, your wings look as weak as parchment."
哈！你是不是忘记了，是谁将你打落天空的。,"Did you forget who it was that defeated you, knocking you from the sky?"
你只是个喜欢偷袭的胆小鬼，这一次我一定会让你明白，谁才是天空的王者！,You are just a coward who loves sneak attacks. I will show you who is the queen of the sky.
我已经给过你机会了，灰烬龙裔，但是你没把握住。,"Nice try, Ember Dragon."
哼！我是不会永远输给你的！等我回来，我会讨回我所失去的一切！,"I will defeat you one day! And on that day, I will take everything from you!"
我已经不在乎你了，灰烬龙裔，我只是为了成为了更高位的存在。,I don't care what you say. Now I am the greatest dragon of all.
我无所畏惧，也无可匹敌！,I fear nothing!

潘多拉，出来吧，鼎鼎大名的灰烬龙女来了！,"Pandora, come out. The most famous Dragon is here."
哎……我以为会是谁呢，原来又是一只跌入梦境的龙。,What?!? Not a dragon again!
少来这套！我知道你在凡间到处晃来晃去，和不少神做着一些不光彩的交易。,"Oh, give it a rest. We all know that you help everyone who comes here."
呵呵，你这说的是什么话，即使如此，你不还是来找我了吗？,Fine! You don't have to be rude about it. So what do you want from me?
哼……潘多拉，我来是寻求力量的，我知道你能满足我的需求。,"Hmm... I know many angels were here before me, seeking their heart's desire. Mine thirsts for power, and I want you to give that to me."
哦？你就这么肯定？但交易是对等的，首先你得有我想要的东西。,"Oh? Are you sure I will give that to you? Let's make a deal. You give me what I want, and then I will give you what you want."
和我打一架再说吧，如果你赢了，就证明你有资格和我做交易。,"But first, prove your worth by fighting me. If you win, then it's a deal."
真是不堪一击，潘多拉。,"You are weak, Pandora."
哼，也就只有一身蛮力而已。,"All you got is brute strength, humph!"
好吧，我带你去寻找你想要的力量，至于你呢……也赶紧想想吧，准备用什么代价来和我换。,"Okay, I will take you to find the power you desire. And you... you need to think about what you will give me in return for my favor."
喂，你怎么停下了，你不是急着要寻找力量吗？,"Hey, why did you suddenly stop?"
打架也是获得力量的一种途径……,It just occurred to me that fighting would be be a good way to gain strength...
潘多拉？你身边的这个家伙是谁？她为什么用一种看食物的眼神盯着我？,Pandora? Who are you with? Why is she looking at me like I'm her prey?
我不知道，但我觉得你麻烦大了……,I think... you may be in trouble now.
等……等下！你们在想什么呢？！我可没准备和她比试！,Wa... wait! What are you thinking? I don't want to fight you!
好烫好烫！快停手！我认输了！,It burns! Stop!!! I surrender.
果然如我所想，即使是魔物，在梦境中也能有这么巨大的力量……,Interesting. Even a weak monster like you can be a source of such strong power in this dreamland.
这倒确实如此，这场战斗后，你的气息好像变强了。,"Yeah, this place is like an amplifier. And if you take advantage of it, you can become more and more powerful."
必然，只要不停挑战强者，自己就会变强，这便是所谓的巨龙之道！,"I see. In that case, I will challenge many strong opponents."
而我要做的，无非是在这条道路上前进而已。,Such is the Way of the Dragon!
是谁闯入了我的神殿？一头龙？你来这里干什么？,Who broke into my temple? A dragon? What are you doing here?
我看到第二个对手了，你的力量并不一般嘛……,I think I have found my second opponent. I sense extraordinary power inside you.
当心，这家伙能把人变成石头，别盯着她的眼睛看。,Watch out! Don't meet her eyes. Her gaze turns living things to stone.
我这身龙鳞可不是白长的，石化术不会对我起效果。,I am not called a dragon just for show. Her petty tricks won't work on me.
是吗？说起来我的石雕中还没收藏过龙呢。,You think so? Let's find out. A dragon statue would be a perfect addition to my garden of stone.
哼，口气倒是不小，好吧，我就让你见识见识龙族的力量！,Big words for a lowly snake. Let me show you how mighty a dragon can be.
没想到，我的魔法和剧毒对你确实不奏效。,Why does my magic and poison not work on you?
我可是货真价实的巨龙，要知道，不少巨龙对魔法的抗性，远超过你的想象。,Real dragons like me have resistance to magic.
对于魔法的抗性……好吧，这也正是我一直在寻求的东西。,I've never heard of anyone having resistance to magic...
如果你不介意，我愿意做为你的侍卫跟随你，直至找到这种力量为止。,"If you don't mind, I'd like to follow you so I can try to understand how this works."
嗯……我没意见，至少接下来的战斗能多一些乐子。,That's fine by me. I'm sure we'll have lots of fun together.
站住！,Wait!
嗯？人类女性，是你在喊我吗？,A human? What do you want with me?
我终于找到你了，准备迎接被审判的命运吧，你这个灾难与战争的根源！,I finally found you. Prepare to face my trial for the disasters and wars you caused!
喂，你可别瞎冤枉好人！不错，我确实是个打架狂，但我只对强者感兴趣！,"Don't go dragging my reputation through the mud. I may love to fight, but I have never done what you are accusing me of."
你不像是个能记起自己焚毁了多少城镇的家伙，对吧？,What about all the towns you burnt? Were those not disasters?!
哼，我只是在践行大自然淘汰弱者的规则罢了，要战便战！,"Hah! That is simply me living by the law of nature - survival of the fittest. But if you think you are a warrior of justice, then let us see if your 'justice' can beat me in a fight."
真是强大的力量……看来我也依旧无法阻止你的暴行。,What a great power you have...
人类，我对弱者可没有什么兴趣，如果你想阻止我的话，强大的力量是不可或缺的。,"I have no interest in the weak, puny human. Challenge me again when you actually have the strength to stop me."
哼……这话可真不象是你这种家伙 能说出的。,You...!
但我不能让你就这么离开，像你这么危险的家伙……,I can't just let you walk away!
哈哈哈……你想跟着就跟着吧，作为我不断变强的见证人吧！,Haha! Then follow me if you wish. I don't care. You can be another witness to my great power... Perhaps you'll even learn something by watching me fight.
末日火山的巨龙？你来得可真不是地方，这可没有你想要的东西。,A dragon from Mount Doom? Why have you come here?
别这么说，北欧的青春女神，你的苹果我想要很久了。,"Don't you know, Idun? I've been eyeing your Golden Apples for a long time."
这可真让人意外，你什么时候改吃素了？,How surprising. When did you become a vegetarian?
我最近打算换换口味而已，毕竟永葆青春是强者必然想要追求的力量。,"It is just a craving. After all, who could resist the temptation of eternal youth?"
那就得看你有没有本事拿到了。,Let's see if you're skilled enough to take a bite out of my apple.
快停手，我给你一个苹果就是了！你这头笨龙，把我裙子都烧焦了……,"Stop! Stop!!! You can have a bite of the apple. You didn't need to burn my skirt, you stupid dragon."
啊，这充满活力的感觉真让人心情愉悦……但还不够，我还需要挑战更强的对手！，,"Ah, how wonderful to feel the energy filling my body. But... This is not enough. I need to find a stronger opponent to fight."
凭你的力量，或许已经足以横扫北欧众神。,No other Nordic Goddesses can stand as your equal now.
你也是个不错的对手，有没有兴趣加入我，看看最后一层梦境藏着什么？,You were an excellent opponent. Do you want to join me and watch as I become the strongest in the world?
听起来挺有意思，就算上我一个吧。,Sounds interesting. Count me in.
多么炽热的光，前面一定有一个强大的对手存在！,That light is blinding. Who is there?
巨龙，你是来这里追求光明的吗？,"Are you seeking the power of light, dragon?"
光明？呃……我不太明白，我只追求强大，绝对的强大！,Light...? I am not sure.
我能感受的到，你身上有着强大而炽热的力量，来和我一战吧！,But I can sense the strong power inside you. Come and fight with me!
如果你确实想较量较量的话，那好吧……愿伟大的光明赐予我力量！,As you wish.
好吧，我真没看出来你追求光明是为了什么，野蛮而粗鲁的家伙……,"Well... I don't know what you are seeking, but I am now certain it has nothing to do with the light. Your brutal way of fighting is nothing like the elegance of the light!"
别多想，亲爱的，作为灰烬与毁灭的化身，我只是为纯粹的强大而已。,I am the embodiment of flame and destruction. I seek only power.
即使如此，我也希望你能善用这份得倒的力量，强大源自于掌控，而非愤怒。,"I wish you would learn to use your power properly. Strength comes from self-control, not anger."
喵，怎么有股烧焦的味道啊，哎？！我的尾巴好像烧着了！,Meow! I smell something burning. ...Ahh! Why is my tail on fire?!?
大和的妖怪？具备看守这层梦境的存在，你的力量我很感兴趣……,Monster of Japan? Even a little monster like you can be in this dreamland.... I am intrigued.
然而你烧了我的尾巴！难道不道歉就想走吗？,You burnt my precious tail!!! It was my loveliest feature. Apologize to me. Now!
哦？是吗？小可爱，你想让我怎样道歉呢？,"Oh yeah? And how are you going to make me do that, little cutie?"
气死我了！我非挠你不可！,Hisssss!! I'm so furious! Feel the wrath of my claws!
嗯哼，或许打一架解决这个问题是最合适的方法呢。,"Bad kitty! If you try to scratch me like that, then you're going to be in trouble."
哎……居然被打哭了，我发誓没下这么重的手。,Oops... I made her cry. I swear I didn't mean it.
你这个大坏蛋！我要去向大和的众神告状！,You are a big bad dragon! I am going to tell the other goddesses of Japan. They will be coming for you!
跑吧，小猫咪，我很期待遇上一个能打的强者，哈哈……,"Run, little kitten, run and go tell them. I look forward to another fight, haha."
这月光中，蕴含着强大的力量……我们似乎开始进入东方诸神所塑造的梦境了。,This moonlight is beautiful.
不过我可没兴趣欣赏这些。,I don't have the time to admire this kind of thing.
你还真是不解风情呢，满脑子只想着打架，可会错过不少有意思的事。,So all you care about is fighting?
风情是什么？能带给我力量吗？,Yes and no. What I care about is becoming stronger.
你……就是那只把猫又打到气得挠墙的火龙吗？,You! Are you the dragon who beat Nekomata?
我很荣幸自己的名声能传得这么快。,"That didn't take long. She's not a good fighter, but she's certainly a fast runner."
呵呵……虽然我不大喜欢粗鲁的家伙，但我可一点也不讨厌强者。,"Humph! I don't care for rude people, but a strong dragon? You are totally my type."
所以对于我来说，打架或许是迎接客人最好的礼仪。,"If you can appreciate the beauty of strength, then I guess you are also worth fighting."
和文静优雅的外貌不同，你是个强大的对手。,You are a strong opponent. I was fooled by your soft elegance.
东方有句古语叫“人不可貌相”……,"You know there is a saying that appearances can be deceiving, right?"
我会留意你这句告诫的，哼哼……,I will keep your words in mind.
东方也有操控火焰的强者么，看来会是一场令人期待的战斗呢。,Hmm... You also have the power to control fire.
火龙么？能够冲入最后由东方神明把守的三层梦境，你看起来并不简单。,Ember Dragon? You have come a long way.
没错，我正为你的力量而来，华夏的火神。,"Yes, and I am coming for you!"
火焰象征着争斗与吞噬，我想你明白这意味着什么。,Fire is a dangerous power that could devour all living beings. Are you sure you want to fight with me? This will not end well.
我很乐意看到愿意用拳头说话的家伙，来吧！,"Since we both understand the risk of fighting fire with fire, bring it on!"
呼……在现实中你不可能有现在这么强，看来梦境确实能够大幅提升能力。,You can't be that powerful in the real world... It seems this place really boosts your power.
是你赢了，你还有一战之力，而我的力量已经耗尽了。,But you still won.
奇怪，我……虽然击败了你，但似乎并没有获得新的力量。,"Even though I defeated you, I don't feel like this victory has made me any more powerful, unlike my previous ones."
你的力量已经超过了大部分神明，神界已经暂时没有能让你挑战的神了。,Your power has already surpassed most of the goddesses. That's why you can't grow stronger.
不，我感到自己还有变强的潜力，有什么办法吗？,But I know I can be more powerful! Are there any other ways?
有一个办法，就是挑战梦境的掌控着！但是风险太高了。,There is one way. And only one goddess knows how to do it.
因为一旦失败，你将很可能会被永远困在梦境中。,"But if you fail, you will be trapped here forever."
如果畏惧，那我的追求就毫无意义！,My pursuit of power means nothing if I retreat.
我将让你与东方的主神之一——伏羲相见，在她的引导下，你会明白什么是力量。,"I will introduce you to one of the Main goddesses of the East, Fuxi. She will tell you the secret of surpassing your limit."
火焰与战意的化身，我已经预见了你的到来。,"The incarnation of flame and war, I have foreseen your arrival."
哦？我还什么都没说，你就猜到我的来意了？,Oh? Then do you know why I am here?
你所追求的力量源于愤怒和冲动，作为宁静的化身，你无法从我这里获得力量。,The power you chased originated from anger and impulse. I am afraid you still have a lesson to learn.
但我可以给你一场试炼，这或许能够让你从中得到感悟。,But the trial I offer may provide some insight.
那么就让我们开始吧！,Let's get started!
呼……这真让人难以相信，我应该已经击倒你好几次了……,"Unbelievable. Even though I have defeated you many times, here you are, still standing unharmed."
我感到自己的力量已经接近极限，但你却仿佛永远不会疲倦似的。,I feel I have reached my limit.
这便是你需要领悟的力量，爆发的火焰虽然强大，却不持久。,This is the lesson you need to learn. An intense flame burns out fast.
就如同我被击倒几百次，只要火种没有熄灭，就能够再次回复，最终赢得胜利。,"I still stand because, unlike you, I save my power for regeneration. I am like the grass. Although fire destroys it, it will always shoot up again later."
……似乎有道理，但又没有那么容易弄明白……,…This seems reasonable. But I am still a little bit confused.
你在之后的战斗中，会明白这个道理的，梦境已经给予了你足够的启发。,You will understand it eventually. It takes time.
……我明白了，不管如何，我会尽力去理解的。,…I see.
你说得没错，我不应过于冲动。,You are right. I shouldn't act on impulse.
你的实力已经在整个龙族名列前茅了，相信未来的你还会变得更强。,I believe you will become more powerful in the future.

虚空裂缝打开了，我的兄弟们！烧光一切，夺取战利品！,"The rift has opened, my brothers! Burn everything and take the spoils!"
站住，你这怪物！只要有我在，你就休想在往前一步！,"Stop, monsters! As long as I'm here, you can't take another step forward!"
虚空的裂缝开启，你们的世界岌岌可危，拜服吧，投降吧，哈哈哈哈！,"Now that the rift has opened, nothing can stop us! Bow down and surrender. Haha!!!"
别痴心妄想了，我会打败你，然后把你踹回你的世界去！,Not a chance! I'll beat you and kick you back to your filthy world!
虚空降临了，你们的抵抗毫无意义，这个可悲世界终将会陷入熊熊燃烧！,"The Void will eventually consume all of you, along with this pathetic world. It's pointless to resist."
也许会有那么一天，但绝不是今天！,"Maybe you are right, the void will eventually come. But I won't let it happen today..."
魔物展示出了强大的压迫力，但显然它还有所保留。,"The monster exhibits a powerful oppressive force, but clearly it is holding back a little."
这家伙是什么人，居然这么厉害？,Who are you!?
我是谁不重要，重要的是你马上就要完蛋了！,It doesn't matter who I am. What matters is that you're going down!
不过就是个说夸夸其谈的小女孩而已，你以为你能拦得住我？,"You think you can stop me, huh? You talk big for a little girl."
你是什么人，竟敢打断我的计划？,Who dares to stop me?
我是这个世界的守护者，有我在，你是不会得逞的！,I'm the guardian of this world. You will not get what you want under my watch!
哈哈哈哈，狂妄的小东西，我会让你见识见识我真正的力量！,Arrogant little thing. I'll show you what real strength looks like.
不，虚空从不失败，你究竟是谁？,"No, the Void never fails. Who are you?"
我是你们这些魔物的克星！看我怎么让你们打回虚空去！,I'm the bane of all monsters!
虚空会吞噬你，吞噬一切！,"The void will devour you, and everything else!"
魔物退缩了半步，它开始狂暴化，并使出全部的力量想要逃跑。,"The monster takes half a step back, begins to go berserk, and uses all its strength to try to escape."
这次就先放过你，再让我碰见，你就完蛋了！,"I'll spare you this time. If I see you again, you will be doomed!"
你不会嚣张太久的，会有其他人来收拾你的。,"Don't get too arrogant, someone else will come and put you in your place."
给我拦住她！别让她追上来！,Stop her! Don't let her catch up!
真是一帮废物！,What a bunch of losers!
你阻止不了我，就像你阻止不了虚空。,"You can't stop me, just like you can't stop the void."
虚空消散了，但总有一天，还会重新凝聚。,"The void has dissipated, but eventually it will gather again."

……看来某人迟到了呢。,... Where is she? She said she'd be here.
非常抱歉，刚刚出了点……小小的岔子。,I'm sorry for being late. I was dealing with something else.
无碍，只要你能按照约定，帮我找到想要的东西就行。,I hope it's taken care of because I need your help. You once promised to help find whatever I want. I'm here to cash in on that promise.
冰霜女士，或许您有必要告知我一下，您的愿望是什么？,"Lady Frost, perhaps you should tell me what it is you seek. I don't read minds."
并非什么麻烦事，我的王座被盗宝者偷了，需要找回来而已。,"I have a problem. A thief stole my throne, and I need to reclaim it."
好吧……这愿望实现的难度还不小，恐怕要与好几个有头有脸的大人物较量了。,Hmm... Stealing your throne must not have been easy. Whoever did it must be very powerful.
在这之前，我最好试试您的实力，以确保……不会发生任何意外。,"Before we begin our search, I must test your strength. I need to be sure you can handle what lies ahead."
来吧，我相信不会让你失望。,Try me. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
怎么样，亲爱的小猫，你还满意吗？,"How was that, kitten? Are you satisfied?"
快把我从冰里放出来……我感觉整个腰以下都动不了了……,Get me out of this ice! I can't feel my legs!
有一个人也许知道，在哪里能找到你想要的东西，让我带你去见见她。,"Finally, I can feel my legs again! All right... So, I know an angel who may know where to find your throne. Let's go see her."
努特，埃及的天空之神，宝藏的守护者，在这里遇到你一点也不意外。,Nuit! Nuit! Do you have a moment?
潘多拉？你找我所为何事？,Pandora? What do you want?
我的新客户……正在寻找她丢失的王座，,My new client is looking for her lost throne. I was wondering whether you know something about it.
她？我很抱歉，以她这样的身份，恐怕只能去抢主神们的御座了。,Frost Dragon? Hah! Does she even deserve a throne?
这是在夸我吗？,How dare you! Explain yourself!
呃……我想你应该可以这么认为。,I think she wants you to prove your strength first.
这事情我挺感兴趣的，不过我想知道合作者的本事如何。,"Hehe, I am sure one of the arrogant Ruling Gods took it. I am willing to help you to take it back. But I need to test your power first. I don't want to be on the losing side in this conflict."
我没意见，与其让我告诉你，不如你亲自体验一下冰霜巨龙的战斗力比较好。,One more helper would be nice. Come on. Let me show you the true power of an ice queen.
看来是一位强而有力的寒冰掌控者呢……,I am impressed. You have mastered the art of controlling ice.
这份力量是否有能力和那些主神较量？,Now do you think I'm strong enough to challenge even the Ruling Gods?
这么说，你是同意了？,"I think so. Don't you agree, Nuit?"
当然了，要是有这样强大的盟友帮助，会比预期的更顺利。,"Of course. But with my help, things would go even more smoothly."
你们是在找龙族王座的下落？我预见了你们的到来。,Are you the ones looking for the Dragon Throne?
预言天使果然还是名不虚传的呢，要我给你颁奖吗？,"Let me guess. You 'foresaw it?' I know you're the angel of prophecy, but do you have to show off your skill every time we meet?"
我还预见到，你们的成功，离不开我的帮助。,"Well, there is something else important that I saw foresaw. You won't find that throne without my help."
这说法可真有趣，但我们凭什么相信你？,That's funny. Why should we trust you?
然而实力比命运更能说明一切，你不觉得？,I trust my own power more than the words coming out of your mouth.
承蒙所愿，一场战斗或许能改变你们的想法。,Are you challenging me? Then what are you waiting for?
真是惊人，看来我低估了北欧巨龙的实力。,Your power is... incredible. It seems that I underestimated the strength of a Nordic Dragon.
但这次失败，也在命运意料之中。,But I also foresaw this failure.
喂喂，失败者可没资格说这样的话。,Just what we'd expect to hear from a loser.
不，我们刚刚所有的战术，其实都被提前预判到了，一对一的话，她并不见得会输。,"No, Nuit. If you had paid attention, she anticipated all of our tactics. If we had battled her one-on-one instead of as a team, then we would have lost."
嗯哼？所以我们最重要的“客户”对于这次胜负怎么看？,"Hmm... What do you think, Frost Dragon?"
天使的能力并没有让人失望。,... It wouldn't hurt to bring her along to help.
嗯，多一个同伴始终不会是坏事。,"Yeah, I agree."
哟，这么快就不行了，我还有好些手段没使出来呢。,"Hail, sister! What are you doing here? You still owe me a fight. Do you remember?"
这是什么蠢话……你没发现风暴正在你身边汇聚吗？,Ember? Are you stalking me? I told you to leave me alone!
……你们俩还真是没完没了，停止这场没有意义的争斗，我需要你们的帮助。,"Stop, both of you. I need your help. It's for the future of our kind."
除非有新的参战者，否则别想让龙族之间的战斗停下来！,Don't try to tell me what to do. You are not my mother.
……乐意奉陪，如果我胜了，你们就暂且停手，帮我去完成此行的目的怎么样？,"... Ember, you know we are not supposed to talk about HER. We made promises to each other."
没问题，来吧！,"So? Who put you in charge? I don't care what you think, and I don't give a shit about you. Come fight me if you dare."
嗯？再不认输，我可就要把你整个都冻成冰块了。,Who's in charge now? Answer me within 3 seconds or I will freeze you solid.
哼，你的冰雪和寒风还是这么难缠。,"Stop, stop! It's you. I yield!"
论战斗经验，我比任何一个北欧的龙族都要丰富。,"Don't talk back to me again. If you do it again, I will not hesitate to put you in the ice hole for thousands of years."
话别说得这么早，你还有一个对手没有倒下。,"Stop. You have scared her, Frost. Don't forget that she's still your sister."
那么，让我来猜猜你能坚持几秒种吧，呵呵。,Are you also questioning my authority?
让我见识一下吧，是你的冰霜厉害，还是我的风暴更强！,"Ember lost because she was still young. But you and I, we trained together."
即使你在梦境中获得了新的力量，但论战术，你依旧不是我的对手。,I know you've been here before and gained new power. But your tactical blunders when we sparred together make me question how much you could've improved.
是吗？三姐妹之中，我的头脑可从来没有输给过你们。,"I've changed because I learn from my mistakes. Besides, I hold my temper better than the two of you."
你们俩废话真多，到底还要不要打？我都不耐烦了！,Don't bore me. Stop talking and let's get this battle started!
强大的寒气，仿佛连风都能冻住一般……,Damn. I can't move...
认输了吗？,Are you throwing in the towel?
我……好吧我认输……暂时的。,"I...... Well, I admit my defeat... for now."
虽然不想承认，但你打的还不赖，至少比我多坚持了几秒钟，哈哈。,"Though I don't want to admit it, your performance isn't bad. You lasted a few minutes longer than me, haha."
哼，没时间开玩笑了，我们最好尽快离开这个梦境。,Hmph! It seems we have no choice but to stop challenging Frost and listen to her if we want to get the hell out of here.
我闻到了熟悉的气息……潘多拉，是你？你来我的地盘做什么？,"Stop, Pandora. I see you trying to sneak around my domain. What are you up to?"
你的地盘？你也不想想现在待着的梦境，究竟归谁管！,Your domain? This is my dreamland. I can go wherever I want.
即便这你是这梦境的掌控者，在没得到我允许之前，也不能进入吧？,Did you forget you promised I could keep a part of it for myself?
这么说你是不想让路了？在你做这个决定前，要不要先问问我身后的三位？,"... Never mind. We just want to pass through quietly. You're happy with that, right?"
哼哼。,Uh oh. Someone's about to lose their temper.
哎呀呀……,Shh! Do you want her to freeze you again?
是吗，我很乐意在花园里多放上三座石雕。,"I see. Trying to avoid looking at me, huh? But maybe I'd like to keep you as stone statues to decorate my domain."
你麻烦大了。,Not unless you can beat our combined might.
看来，你的石化魔法还是没有巨龙的冰霜好用啊，你就在这儿好好呆一阵子吧。,It seems that your petrification magic is still not as good as the dragon's frost.
你……,You......
也该到了处理正事的时间了，前面应该是主神的领域了吧？,Let's go. We don't have time to waste on this. Are we close to the realm of the Ruling Gods?
如您所想，冰霜女士，以我们的速度很快就能抵达。,"Yes, Lady Frost. It's just a bit further."
小心点，这是波塞冬的梦境，她脾气很差，连我都要忌惮她几分。,Be careful. This is Poseidon's place. She has a bad temper. Even I don't dare to mess with her.
而她手上，可能有你想要的东西。,But she may have the thing that you want...
潘多拉，你带这些人来到我统治的海域，是什么意思？,Pandora! Are you talking about me? You dare accuse me of having a bad temper?
别生气亲爱的，我们只是到这里来，向你寻求一件宝物的。,I... I... No! You must have heard wrong. The dragons and I are just here looking for something. That's why I've brought them to see you. The mighty god of the sea must know where we can find it.
遗憾的是，我这里没有什么值得你们抢的。,What are you looking for? Would it be the Dragon Throne? I haven't seen it. Wait... Are you thinking of stealing mine instead?
“抢”这个字我不喜欢，不如用“送”吧，你“送”给我们。,"Stealing? Haha... No, no... That's such a strong choice of words. 'Asking' is a better word. We're asking you to give it to us."
很好，在把你们打到站不起来后，我会有兴趣问问你们想要什么。,Over my dead body!
你们最好别太得意，总有一天，我会回来和你讨回这笔账的……,You better watch your back from now on. You filthy dragons! I will return for payback!
她脱离梦境了？,She just disappeared.
看起来是这样，当一个人的愿望无法被满足时，就会被梦境驱逐。,"If one fails to get what one wants, one will immediately return to reality."
说实话，她比我想象中要强。,"To be honest, she was stronger than I thought."
不过她再强，也不是我们龙族三姐妹联手的对手。,But not stronger than us.
虽然波塞冬的王座足够华丽，但这并非是我丢失的宝物。,Look at her throne. It is not the one we lost.
那不妨我们往东走看看，提到收集宝物，那个家伙可能也会对你的王座感兴趣……,Then let's go east. There might be another angel who may have a motive to take your throne.
欢迎来到东方的亡者国度黄泉比良坂，当然，这里只是梦境的幻象所化。,"Welcome to the dreamland version of the Land of the Dead, called Yomotsu Hirazaka."
我可以感受到强大的存在。,I can feel that someone powerful is around.
传说中的黄泉之主——伊邪那美。,"Yes, that is the legendary lord of the Yellow Springs, Izanami."
嗯？是何人在称呼我的真名？,Who is there?
……北欧的冰霜巨龙，来此寻找丢失的宝物。,"... It is me, Frost Dragon, and my sisters. We are looking for the Dragon Throne."
宝物？虽然我身为黄泉统治者，没有搜寻异宝的兴趣……,I have no interest in exotic treasures or status symbols.
但我在这梦境待了几千年，都快无聊死了，要是能陪我玩玩，也许……,"But after thousands of years in this dream, I'm dying of boredom. I'll tell you what... Play with me a little and I might consider offering some clues."
……也许你会告诉我们宝物的下落？,What do you mean by 'play a little'?
好提议，但前提是你们能让我尽兴才行。,"... Come, let me see if you know how to wield that spear you hold."
呵呵……真是没让我失望，好久没有这样的乐子了。,Hehe... That was fun!
至于宝物，就在我的神社中随便拿吧，我对那些放了几千年的东西早就不感兴趣了。,"You can look around in my shrine. If you find anything you like, just take it."
这家伙，意外的好说话……,Really!? Wow!
遗憾的是，这里并没有我丢失的王座。,"You look way too excited, Pandora. Unfortunately, the throne is not here."
你是北欧的神明，如果丢了东西，不是应该到奥丁那儿去问问吗？,"Hey, you guys are from Scandinavia, right? Why don't you go ask the Norse god, Odin?"
……不错的主意，你提醒我了。,"That's a great idea! Sisters, we'd better get going!"
这里是北欧众神的神域，宏伟的阿斯加德王宫。,"Here we are, the domain of the Nordic Angels, the Asgard dreamland."
这梦境有几分我熟悉的凉意，宫殿上雕刻着我族的花纹，还堆积着雪……,Odin sure enjoys a comfortable home.
……奥丁的日子看上去过得挺舒服。,Look at all those beautiful palaces...
北欧的三大龙族？是什么风把你们吹到我这来了。,The dragon family? What are you doing here?
我的巢穴遇上了些麻烦，神王奥丁，我来这里为了找一件宝物。,I'm here to find my stolen throne.
那么代价呢？,And what does it have to do with me?
一场让你满意的战斗，应该能让你认可北欧龙族的力量。,You are the queen of Nordic Angels. I bet you know where my throne is.
呵，让我们开始吧。,How dare you accuse me of stealing it! I'll teach you a lesson!
不错，你的力量超乎我的想象，你的族裔在我的神殿中，能有一席之地的荣耀。,Your strength is beyond my imagination. I would be honored if your kind accepted a place within my palace.
那么问题来了，你所求的宝物是什么？,"Back to the throne you are talking about, I know where it is."
王座，真正属于龙族的王座。,Where is it?
有意思，所以你愿意找回丢失的那尊王座，还是说……希望得到更珍贵的恩赐？,But I know of something far better than a throne. Do you want to know what it is? I'll give you a hint: It's far more valuable.
如果你不介意的话，我更期待后者。,I am interested. What is it?
你们龙族的勇气一向让我敬佩，进入面前的传送门吧。,"The courage of your kind has always impressed me. Now, enter the portal in front of you."
传送门后的梦境，应该能让你得到比王座更珍贵的东西。,I am sure you will find something more valuable than your throne.
……这是什么地方，我感到混沌与黑暗的气息弥漫在四周。,What is this place? I feel like I'm surrounded by chaos and darkness.
奥丁，你又想逃跑吗？这一次，我要把你和你那可笑的宫殿一起吞入黑暗！,"Odin, is that you? I'm going to make this darkness swallow both you and your ridiculous palace."
阿佩普……天哪，这鬼地方应该是北欧神王的噩梦。,Apep... I knew we couldn't trust that despicable Odin.
奥丁与埃及的破坏神在几千年前就一直争斗，这场恶梦也延续了几千年。,She and Apep have been fighting for thousands of years in my dreamland!
……我们要如何出去？,... How are we going to get out?
结束这场恶梦，除了击败阿佩普的梦魇，没有别的办法。,There is only one way to end this nightmare. We must defeat Apep.
不管如何，有架打啦。,Sounds like we have a fight to win.
让开，北欧的龙族，这是我和奥丁的战争！,"Get out of my way, Nordic Dragons. This is between Odin and me!"
……抱歉了，按照我和奥丁刚签的协议，她的战争就是我的战争。,... I have no choice.
阿斯加德……我复仇的怒火迟早会重新燃起的……,"Ahhh! Asgard... Sooner or later, my vengeful anger will be reborn..."
即使现实中她并不强，但在梦境也能变成如此可怕的对手……,I didn't realize that she could be such a difficult foe.
在与她战斗之后，我仿佛也能感受到自己的力量，有了不可想象的提升。,"After fighting her, it seems my strength has greatly improved."
呵……相对于那个无聊的王座，力量与权力才是你渴求的东西吧？,Does your dull throne seem so wonderful now? Or is it power that you truly crave?
……不错的问题，我会在离开梦境后好好寻找答案的。,... Is my ambitions that obvious?
物归原主即可。,I don't care. All I care is to take back my throne!
阿斯加德的时光门，能够寻回任何原本属于你的东西。,Fine. This is Asgard's Time Gate.
去取回你丢失的宝物吧，那尊王座就在里面。,Think of the last time you saw your throne and this gate will take you there.

古埃及神话中法老的守护神，王权的象征，同时她也是复仇之神，掌管着法律和秩序！\n她曾为父报仇，击败埃及残暴的统治者赛特，成为新一代的埃及统治神。,"In ancient Egyptian mythology, Horus is the guardian angel of pharaohs, a symbol of royal authority. She is also the goddess of revenge, presiding over law and order.\nShe defeated Set, the cruel ruler of Egypt, and avenged her father. She then became the new ruling god of Egypt. It is said she loved her people more than herself."
我曾经很坚定的认为，这个世界上不会有人能让我为之心动，直到你的出现，让我曾经的坚定化作了泡影。,"I used to believe that no one in this world could make my heart flutter, until I met you."
荷鲁斯之眼,The Eye of Horus
埃及神话中至高无上的神器，它代表着神明的庇佑与至高无上的君权，也代表着最为真实的目光。,This supreme artifact from Egyptian mythology represents the divine protection and ultimate sovereignty of the gods. It is said no one can lie while under the gaze of The Eye of Horus.
神之传承,Divine Legacy
鹰神之翼,Eagle Wings
埃及之心,Heart of Egypt
天命之子,Angel of Destiny
为什么总有人觉得，我是一个危险的女人呢？,Why does everybody think I am a dangerous woman?
这世界上最美妙的东西，到底是权力还是爱情？,What is the most wonderful thing in the world? Power or Love?
我一直都认为，仇恨的力量会使人更加强大！,I have always believed that hatred makes one more powerful.
做为古埃及的统治者，我一直都将自己的一切奉献给我的子民，从不敢懈怠！,"As the ruler of ancient Egypt, I always put my people first."
你觉得，古埃及的神明，给人的第一印象是什么样的？,What is your first impression of the God of ancient Egypt?
为什么总有人觉得，魅力不能与力量共存呢？,Why do people always feel that charm cannot coexist with power?
因为你的魅力太大。,Because you are charming.
因为你拥有强大的力量！,Because you have great power.
我觉得是权力！,I think it is power!
我觉得是爱情！,I think love prevails all.
仇恨确实能激发潜能。,Hatred can indeed stimulate power inside one's body.
仇恨容易让人丧失理智。,But hatred can easily make people lose their rationality.
你也该多为自己着想。,You should think about yourself more.
你是一个令人敬佩的女王！,You are an admirable queen!
充满神秘色彩的。,Full of mystery.
美丽而又庄严的。,Beautiful and dignified.
或许是人们畏惧强大的力量。,Maybe it's because they fear the one who has it all.
你就是魅力与力量共存的女神。,"Because they haven't met you, the embodiment of both charm and power."
看来大家都觉得，越迷人的女人越危险！,"It seems that everyone thinks the more charming a woman is, the more dangerous she is!"
是这样么！但我更希望人们对我的感觉是崇拜和仰慕。,"But I would prefer for people to feel admiration towards me, rather than fear."
我曾经拥有无上的权力，可为什么我并不觉得开心呢？,"I had supreme power over the whole of Egypt a long time ago, but I never felt happy back then."
是么！那我也想品尝一下，爱情的滋味。,Then I want a taste of love.
你也这么认为吗？那我更加坚定，我当初为父报仇是正确的选择！,Then I am more certain that avenging my father was the right choice!
谢谢你的提醒，我会时刻保持理智，不会让仇恨吞噬自己的。,Thank you for reminding me of that. I will try not to let hatred consume me.
你是第一个叫我为自己着想的人，这种感觉，真奇妙。,You are the first person to tell me that. Thank you.
我很喜欢这种，被人认可的感觉。,Being recognized like that makes me happy.
保持神秘才会让敌人猜不透你！不过在你面前，我倒是可以揭开神秘的面纱。,"Being mysterious will prevent the enemy from knowing your next moves! But I don't have to hide in front of you, right?"
这是一个很高的评价，我很喜欢。,"This is a very high compliment, and I like it."
是这样吗？但我的力量，却是用来保护我的人民的。,Is that so? Then they are being narrowminded. My power is used to protect my people.
哈哈……是的！我对自己的魅力和力量，都很有自信。,Is that so? Well I am confident in both my charm and my power.
你就是传闻中的，守护秘密与知识的女神潘多拉？,"Are you the goddess Pandora, who guards secrets and knowledge?"
没错，那么金字塔王权的守护者，荷鲁斯，是什么风把你给吹来了？,"And what brings the guardian of the pyramid and the king's power, the mighty Horus, to my domain?"
拉神失踪了，埃及众神一片混乱，吞噬者阿佩普无人约束……黑暗即将降临。,"Ra has gone missing, and chaos has engulfed the Egyptian gods. The Devourer Apep is unrestrained, and darkness is imminent."
我需要找到拉神的权杖，替代她执行维护埃及秩序的职责。,I need to find Ra's scepter and take up her responsibility of maintaining order in Egypt.
哦？你现在的力量还不足以掌控埃及神系，所以才需要拉神的权杖，对吗？,Oh? Your power is not enough to control the Egyptian pantheon. Is that why you need her scepter?
它是件强大的神器，能够聚集太阳的力量，驱散一切黑暗。,It is a powerful artifact that can harness the power of the sun and dispel all darkness.
是吗？既然它这么有价值，那么我为何要把它交给你，而不是自己留下呢？,"Is that so? Since it is so valuable, why should I give it to you instead of keeping it for myself?"
理由很简单，你的力量可无法驱动它，潘多拉。,"The reason is simple. Your power is insufficient to activate it, Pandora."
呵呵，口气真大，不如用实力来证明一下吧。,"Ha, you're quite confident. Why don't we prove it with a show of strength?"
怎么样，这下你该相信我的话了？,"So, do you believe me now?"
呼……好吧，我就不打它主意了……暂时的。,"Alright, I will accept it... for now."
嗯哼，那就请你开始这场交易吧。,"Hmph, then get started."
别着急，亲爱的，让咱们先好好谈谈价格……,"Hold on, dear. Let's talk about the details first..."
我这里虽说是梦境，但有梦往往是通往现实目的的最佳途径。,"Although this place is a dreamland created by my Box, it is the best way to achieve what you wish for in reality."
当然，梦境有时也是充满危险的。,"Of course, dreams can also be very, very dangerous."
它会倒影出你心中最深的恐惧，小心……你的梦魇来了。,They can reflect your deepest fears. Be careful... One such nightmare is here now.
荷鲁斯，我已经等你多时了。,"Horus, I've been waiting for you for a long time."
呵……阿努比斯？她可谈不上是我的梦魇……顶多淘气的时候有点麻烦而已。,"Heh...Anubis? She's hardly my nightmare... at most, she's a nuisance."
拉神让我在这里等你，如果你想要取得她的权杖，必须经受我的考验。,"Ra has asked me to wait for you here. If you want to obtain her scepter, you must pass my test."
你的考验是什么？找我打一架吗？,What is your test? Do you want to fight me?
这只是首先要做的事。,"Yes, but that is just the beginning of my test."
你认可我的力量吗？阿努比斯。,"Do you acknowledge my strength, Anubis?"
只有强大的力量是不够的……,"Hmph, great power on its own is not enough."
怎么，你该不会还想称一称我灵魂的重量吧？,"What, are you going to weigh my soul too?"
那倒不必，你的高尚无容置疑。,That's not necessary. Your nobility is beyond doubt.
但我必须跟在你身边，见证你度过一个个难关。,But I must follow you and witness you overcome each difficulty.
好吧，看来死神大人也有偷窥他人梦境的情调。,"Alright, it seems that even the Goddess of Death has a penchant for peeping into others' dreams."
别这么说，旅途中有强大的伙伴加入并不是什么坏事。,Don't be like that. It is not a bad thing to have powerful companions join you on this journey.
你可千万别这么想！她要是捣起蛋来，还是很让人头疼的。,"If she causes trouble, it will be a headache for us."
奈芙蒂斯，你怎么在这里？,"Nephthys, what are you doing here?"
这儿可是我的领域，这句话不该我来问你吗？,"This is my realm, shouldn't I be asking you that?"
呃，从这阵势来看……你们应该不是来欣赏我制作木乃伊的吧？,"Well, looking at this situation... I guess you're not here to admire my mummification skills, are you?"
你暂时被我邀请到了梦境里，成为荷鲁斯试炼的一环。,"Actually, you've been invited to this dreamland to be a part of Horus' trial."
是吗？那正好，我刚想试试梦境里自己是不是能变得更强。,"Is that so? Perfect timing, I was just about to test if I can become stronger in a dream."
那么没必要多说了，来吧！,"Alright then, let's fight!"
别打了别打了，虽然是梦境，但是挨揍还是一样痛……,"Wait! Wait! Hold on. Even though we are in a dream, it still hurts to get hit..."
你比现实世界强得多，难道在梦境中的成长速度会更快？,"You've become much stronger in this dreamland. Interesting, does one grow faster here than in the real world?"
你的意思是……？,What are you suggesting?
我的意思是加入你们的队伍，看看到底怎么回事。,I am suggesting that I join your team and fight alongside you.
看起来有些我没有邀请的家伙也来这里做客了呢，你的对头还真不少啊。,It looks like some uninvited guests have arrived. You sure do have a lot of enemies.
看来天使们还在为当年的事情斤斤计较呢，只要有机会她们准会掺和进来。,It seems that they are still holding a grudge over the past. They will meddle any chance they get.
如果你还是在用过去的思维审视我等，那就太遗憾了。,Don't give us that look. We are not the same as back then.
拉神的太阳权杖不仅决定埃及众神的命运，对天使们来说也是至关重要。,"The Scepter of Ra not only decides the fate of the Egyptian gods, but is also crucial for us angels."
我们不能放任它落到邪恶的家伙手中！,We can't let it fall into the wrong hands!
哎呀……这话可真难听……,Oh my... that's quite insulting.
你曾经以复仇之神著称，我不敢保证你是否还留有那段糟糕的记忆和性格。,You were once known as the God of Vengeance. I can't be sure that you don't still have that terrible personality.
太阳权杖的归属是我们埃及神明的事情，这事不用你们担心。,The Scepter of Ra is the business of us Egyptian gods. It is none of your concern.
况且，我的复仇实际上意味着节制与公平，而非疯狂。,"Besides, my vengeance was exacted with restraint and fairness, not madness."
如果你坚持的话，那就必须通过我的考验。,"If you insist on going after the Scepter, you must first pass my test."
呵呵，我不介意接受你的考验。,Try me.
你输了，加百列，以你的力量，恐怕阻止不了我。,Your strength is not enough to stop me.
荷鲁斯，你变强了不少，确实让我有些出乎意料。,"Horus, you've become much stronger than I expected."
我虽然阻止不了你，但我会跟着你，确保你不会变成我想象中的那样。,"I may not be able to stop you, but I can follow you to make sure you don't become what I fear you will."
呼……监视我吗？好吧，如果你能在危急时刻帮我一把，我倒也没意见。,"So you mean to keep an eye on me, huh? Well, if you can lend a hand when I'm in trouble, I don't mind."
努特，你怎么也在这里？,"Nuit, what are you doing here?"
我的姐妹，盖布，被一个神秘的家伙拉入了梦中，我是追寻她来到这里的。,My sister Geb was kidnapped by Ra. I came here to find her.
那你找到她了吗？,Have you found her yet?
努特，你怎么了？,"Nuit, what's the matter with you?"
她似乎被人操控了……糟糕，我怎么没想到呢，是那个家伙。,"It seems she's being controlled by someone... Oh no, I should have thought of this. It must be her."
那个家伙？,Who?
方塔苏斯，和我一样可以操控梦境的女神。但这个家伙是恶梦的缔造者。,"Phantasos, a goddess who can manipulate dreams like me. But... she is also the creator of nightmares."
没错，而且糟糕的是，你们现在已经脱离了潘多拉的梦境，到了我的领域……,"Indeed I am. And unfortunately for you, you're no longer in Pandora's dreamland... You're in my realm. The realm of Nightmares."
潘多拉，你我还有一笔账没算完呢。,"Pandora, I believe you and I have some unfinished business."
我不管你们有什么恩怨，先把努特放了。,I don't care about that... Just release Nuit first!
差点忘记你们的存在，去吧，天空之神努特，让他们见识见识你的力量。,"Oh, do you mean this Goddess of the Sky? Nuit, show them your power!"
遵命，主人。,"Yes, master."
啊……,Ah...
荷鲁斯？我，我这是怎么了？,Horus? What happened?
方塔苏斯控制了你，盖布应该也在她的控制之中。,Phantasos had taken control of your mind. Geb is probably also under her control
没错，我为你们姐妹俩都做了安排。不过你脱离控制这件事，在我的意料之外。,"That's right, I made both sisters into my puppets. But to think you could escape my control like this... I did not expect that."
盖布呢？你把她怎么了？,What have you done to Geb? Where is she?
想知道的话，就到更深层的梦境中来吧，呵呵……,"If you want to know, follow me deeper into my realm, hehe."
你们想见的人就在这里，只不过她还认不认识你们，就是另外一回事了。,"Here she is. But I don't think she will recognize any of you, hehe. Not even her own sister."
盖布！,Geb!
任何打乱主人计划的人，都要付出代价。,Anyone who disrupts the master's plan will have to pay the price.
方塔苏斯，埃及的众神似乎并没有得罪过你吧？,"Phantasos, the gods of Egypt have not offended you, have they?"
我的确与你们无冤无仇，但为了太阳权杖……你们明白的。,"It is true that I have no grievances with you, but for Ra's Sun Scepter... Well, you understand."
有了太阳权杖，我就能摆脱哈迪斯的掌控，成为冥界的新主人。,"With that scepter, I can finally break free from Hades' control and become the new master of the underworld."
所以说，你也是为了太阳权杖而来。,So you're doing this to get the Sun Scepter. Keep dreaming!
只有埃及神能够激活太阳权杖的力量，我需要一个傀儡，成为我使用它的替身。,It is said that only an Egyptian god can activate the power of the Scepter. So I made one into my puppet to use it for me.
话说够了，开始你们的战斗吧！,"Now, enough talking."
盖布，你清醒过来了吗？,"Geb, can you hear me? Geb?"
我的身体好痛，发生什么了？,"Ow, my body hurts. What happened?"
你受伤了，别动……,"You were injured, don't move..."
方塔苏斯那个家伙居然逃跑了，见鬼。,We let Phantasos escaped. Damn it.
别急，我相信她会主动找上我们的。,"Don't worry, I believe she will eventually come to us."
方塔苏斯鬼鬼祟祟的，原来就是躲着你们这几个家伙啊。,I was wondering why Phantasos is being so sneaky. It turns out she is hiding from you lot.
阿波罗？怎么，连你也想要来抢太阳权杖吗？,Apollo? Are you also here for the Scepter?
我？抱歉，我对这玩意没有兴趣，因为我本身就可以使用太阳的力量。,Me? I have no interest in that thing. I am capable of using the power of the sun on my own.
但我对其他能够动用太阳之力的人都不太放心，我可以信任拉，但无法信任她之外的人。,But I don't trust anyone other than myself and Ra to wield the power of the sun properly.
你想要阻止我？,So you want to stop me from getting it?
或者说是考验？看看你有没有肩负太阳的气量。,More like a test. Let me see if you're worthy of such power.
你的力量超乎我的想象。,Your strength is beyond my imagination.
你也不赖，阿波罗，我差一点点就输了——如果没有伙伴帮助的话。,"You're not bad either, Apollo. I almost lost. If not for my allies' help, I would have lost."
好吧，我姑且认可你有资格掌握太阳之力，不过你要小心……,"Alright, I will acknowledge your capability for now. But be careful..."
因为当我认为你没资格的时候，我还会回来取回太阳权杖的。,"Because the moment I think you are no longer worthy of it, I will take the Scepter from you."
真让人失望，我还以为阿波罗能多坚持一会呢。,What a disappointment! I thought Apollo would hold out longer than that.
真让人失望，我知道你迟早会回来找我，但没想到这么快。,I am also disappointed to see you again so soon.
别太得意了，你现在可是在我梦境领域之中。,"Don't get too cocky. You know you're still in my realm, right? I can summon anything here."
在我的梦境中，我可以召唤出任何存在！让我看看你们该如何对付太阳本身！,Let's see how you deal with the Sun itself!
谁在呼唤我？荷鲁斯？你们怎么会在这里？,Who's calling me? Horus? What are you doing here?
……拉神，不，这只是方塔苏斯创造的幻影。,"… Ra? No, this is only an illusion created by Phantasos."
的确，然而即使是这样在，她也会发挥出在你心目中应有的力量！,"Indeed, but even so, she will be as powerful as you think she should be!"
我们击败拉神了？这简直难以置信……,We defeated Ra? This is unbelievable...
和拉交战让我感觉……很不好受。,Fighting Ra made me feel... uncomfortable.
毕竟只是创造出来的幻影，你不用太过意不去。,It's just an illusion. Don't dwell on it.
哎呀，真是可惜……,"Oh well, what a pity..."
方塔苏斯，你会为此付出代价的！,"Phantasos, you will pay for this!"
看来我不得不在这里和你们开战了，这可真让人感到刺激。,It looks like I get to fight you again. How exhilarating.
你都到了走投无路的时候了，还这么乐观的吗？,Big words for a loser.
小心说话，潘多拉，这里可是我的梦境，我的力量依旧占据上风。,"Watch your tongue, Pandora. This is my realm, and my power still reigns supreme."
嗯哼？我倒是想要见识见识。,Hmm? I'm curious to see what you can do.
啊，你们这群……这群家伙！我迟早会回来的……,"Ah, you... You! The scepter is mine! Sooner or later, I will have it."
住手吧，方塔苏斯，这场闹剧该结束了。,"Stop, Phantasos. This farce has gone on long enough."
拉？你……你不是我创造出来的幻影吗？,Ra? Aren't you just an illusion that I created?
我的神威无处不在，即便是在你的领域，我也仍旧能借助这幻影现身。,"My divine power is omnipresent, even in your realm. Thus I can manifest through this illusion you created."
你想干什么？,What do you want from me?
我对你这样的小角色没什么兴趣，但你的梦境挺有意思……,Nothing. I have no interest in such a small and pitiful goddess. But your dreamland on the other hand...
荷鲁斯，上前来。,"Horus, come forward."
遵命。,"Yes, my Lord."
我感受到了你对埃及众神的信念，我也的确想要看看你是否能够成为众神的引导者。,I sense your faith in the Egyptian gods. I want to see if you are capable of becoming their leader.
如你真的够格，我便允许让你指掌太阳权杖。,"And if you prove your worth through my test, I will allow you to wield my scepter."
我对太阳的神权并无觊觎之心，我只想让众神少一些争端罢了。,I have no desire for the divine power of the Sun. I just want there to be less conflict among the gods.
无论如何，你都将面对自己的噩梦，你愿意接受挑战吗？,So do you want to take my test?
我愿意接受挑战！,I am up for the challenge!
很好，准备战斗吧。,"Very well, prepare for battle."
做好准备，你将会遭遇我千百年来所面对的敌人。,"Be ready, for you will face the biggest enemy that I have faced for thousands of years."
苏醒吧，阿佩普！,"Awaken, Apep!"
混乱之主阿佩普……天哪，我做梦也不想看见她……,"The Lord of Chaos, Apep... I wanted never to see her, not even in my dreams..."
真让我惊讶，你通过了考验，或许这柄太阳权杖交给你是命运的选择。,"I'm surprised, you have passed the test. It's time to hand over this scepter to you."
我将面对自己的责任。,I will face my responsibilities with confidence.
接下来的一百年内，你将代替我行使掌控埃及众神的职能，愿太阳庇佑你。,"During the next hundred years, you will act as the leader of the Egyptian gods on my behalf. May the sun bless you."
抱歉……我还没准备好。,"Sorry, I don't think I am ready for that."
好吧，或许有一天，你依旧能接下掌控埃及神权的责任。,"Alright, perhaps someday you will be able to bear that responsibility."

伊娃诞生自群星之间的虚幻花园，在一颗流星的包裹下，坠落在了这个世界。她固执地认为，在未来的某刻，日月将会颠倒，群星陷入混乱，而只有人类才有能力扭转这一危机。她懂得如何通过星星的移动预知未来，她的预言中，有位来自另外一片星空的天命之人将会拯救这个世界，而伊娃则一直在等待此人的到来。,"Eva was born from the illusory garden among the stars, and fell to this world in a meteor. She stubbornly believes that at some point in the future, the sun and moon will turn upside down and the stars will fall into chaos, and only one human has the ability to avert this crisis. She knows how to predict the future through the movement of the stars. In her prophecy, a human of destiny from another world will save the universe. Eva has been patiently waiting for her arrival."
星辰指引着我来到你身边，愿命运赐予你勇气与信念。,The stars guide me to your side. May fate grant you courage and faith.
我的角又长长了一公分！,My horns grew another centimeter!
喂，你一直都躲在远处偷偷地盯着我看吧？是又想我了吗？,"Hey, you've been hiding in the distance and secretly staring at me, haven't you? Did you miss me again?"
魔法的力量能够移动星星，改变昼夜，可有时候想变出一块香喷喷的面包都做不到。,"My magic can move the stars and change the day and night, but it is impossible to conjure a piece of delicious bread!"

太阳祭司,Sun Priest
凡蒂丝,Vandis
太阳祭司：所有上阵女神的生命值提升300000。,"Sun Priest: Increases HP of all line-up angels by 300,000."
据说羽蛇是太阳的后代，身上永远保留着神性，因此，羽蛇世世代代都被训练成为太阳的祭司。凡蒂丝也是如此，她居住在被遗忘的古老庙宇，虽然早已无人参拜，但她依旧相信祷告能让这个世界风调雨顺。直到某天，在她祷告时，冥冥之中的声音在她耳边响起：一位带着重要使命的人类将会出现……,"It is said that the Feathered Serpents are descendants of the sun and will retain their divinity forever. Therefore, they have been trained as priests of the sun god for generations. The same is true for Vandis. She lives in an ancient temple that has been forgotten. Although no one has visited it for a long time, she still believes that prayer can make the world a better place. Until one day, when she was praying, a mysterious voice sounded in her ears: a human being with an important mission will appear..."
我因听见你的祈祷而降临，愿太阳的恩赐与我的祝福常伴于你身边。,I came to hear your prayer. May the gift of the sun and my blessing always be with you.
多看看我，你就会发现，即便是高高在上的祭司，也有少女的一面。,"You know, even though I'm a high priest, I still have my girlish side."
狮鹫？在人类看来，长着翅膀的蛇就够奇怪了，想不到还有长着翅膀的猫……,"Griffon? In the eyes of humans, snakes with wings are strange enough, but there are cats with wings..."
你好像对我的尾巴挺感兴趣……要摸摸看吗？手感很不错的哦！,You seem to be very interested in my tail... Do you want to pet it? It feels very good!

蕾傲妮与其他的狮鹫一样，在刚成年时就离开了父母，在山崖上搭建了属于自己的小房子，过着离群索居的生活——一个人捕猎，一个人烹饪美食。直到那个人类的到来，她的光辉让蕾傲妮无法挪开双眼。很快，蕾傲妮就选择离开了悬崖上的家，跟随着那个人的足迹，希望某天能为她效命。,"Like other griffons, Leonie left her parents when she reached adulthood, built her own small house on the cliff, and lived a life of isolation—hunting and cooking alone. One day, a human being arrived, and her brilliance caught Leonie's eyes. The young griffon then chose to leave her home on the cliff and follow in that person's footsteps, hoping to serve her one day."
请让我翱翔在你左右，直到拂晓与黄昏的尽头。,Please let me soar by your side until the end of time.
有兴趣让我在你身边睡一会吗？我挺喜欢这样……,Interested in letting me sleep next to you for a while? I would like that...
又到了脱毛的季节了，每当这个时候，我都会担心我的翅膀会秃掉。,It's the season when our feathers molt. I always used to worry that my wings might fall off as well and never grow back.
幻兽的种类还真是多得让我惊讶，在离开家乡前，我可没见过这么多彩的世界。,"I'm amazed to be surrounded by so many other kinds of Eudemons. Before I left my hometown, I had never imagined such stunning diversity."

DRIFTING_DUNGEON_DEFEAT_TIPS,Challenge failed. Do you want to ask for help from your friends?
新的挑战开启,New Challenge Available
请问你是潘多拉女士吗？,Are you Pandora?
猜对啦！倒是你……从外表看来，是东方人吧？让我来看看你的真名……,"Yeah, who are you? Based on how you're dressed, I'd say you're from the East."
嗯……如果我没猜错的话，你是大韩的沈青儿？来找我这名灾厄的掌控者，所为何事？,"Hmm... If my guess is right, you are Sim Cheong, the Korean peasant girl turned empress from Korean folklore. What do you want from me?"
我的子民们得了一种加速衰老的病，我到处找医治的方法，但都没效果。,"My people have contracted a disease that accelerates aging. I have searched everywhere for a cure, but nothing works."
我听人说，你可以帮人实现愿望，所以我……想来找你帮帮忙。,"I heard that you can help people fulfill their wishes, so I… came to ask for your help."
我又不是圣诞老人，怎么可能帮人实现愿望？何况，找我帮忙可都是需要代价的。,"I'm not a genie, so how could I possibly grant people's wishes? Besides, my help comes at a price."
为了大韩的子民，我愿意付出任何代价！,"For the sake of my people, I am willing to pay any price!"
喔！你身上的珍贵之物可真不少……确实值得我帮你解决这个麻烦。,I admire your selfless nature and your willingness to sacrifice for the sake of others. You are certainly worthy of my help.
然而梦境领域可不是游乐场，里面充满了各种危险，你的实力能应对吗？,"However, the dream realm is a dangerous place and what happens here affects your body in the waking realm. Are you strong enough to handle it?"
很遗憾，我……并不太擅长打架。,"Unfortunately, I… am not very good at fighting."
看来你需要个小小的测试呢，不过放心吧，我会留一手的。,"How about a little test then? Don't worry, I will hold back."
哎哟……你确定自己……不怎么会打架？,Ouch… Are you sure you… are not very good at fighting?
呃……我可能下手有些不知道轻重，请千万不要见怪……,Uh… I may have been a bit too heavy-handed. I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you.
不过你的能力，大多数都倾向于和同伴的配合，或许我们应该去找几个帮手……,"You know... your greatest strength seems to be your shields, so maybe we should find you a few companions. That way you can focus on supporting them while they do the fighting."
嗯，我想到两个合适的同伴了！,And I have two in mind who would be perfect!
熊女，快出来！我们需要你的帮助。,"Ungnyeo, come out! We need your help."
哎？！又要帮忙啊，可我不想再去那些危险的梦境里了。,Again?! But this dream world is so dangerous. I really don't want to do this again.
上次闯入其他梦境时，被坏家伙们揍得够呛，我再也不会相信你了。,"Last time, we stumbled into a nightmare, and I got beaten up. I don't trust you anymore."
安心啦，这次的同伴我想你不会陌生，是个很可靠的人。,Don't worry. Didn't you notice my companion? It's Sim Cheong! She's very reliable.
真的？,"Sim Cheong...? Hmm that name sounds vaguely familiar, but I can't quite place it."
看来只有打一架才能让你的熊脑袋开开窍啦。,"Maybe a good bop on the head will awaken your memories, you sluggish, grumpy bear."
不打了不打了，认输了！我可没想到会直接面对如此铜墙铁壁般的防守。,No more fighting. I yield! How is your shield so strong?
虽然我并不擅长进攻，但对于保护好同伴这件事，还是很有信心的……,"Instead of offense, I channel everything into protecting my companions. ... By the way, Ungnyeo, are you also from Korea?"
嗯……看在沈青儿同为大韩神明，而且实力不俗的前提下，我就帮你们一次吧。,"Yes! So that's why I recognized your name. We come from the same place! In that case, I'll help you out this time."
谢谢你，一路上还请你多关照。,"Great, I'd love to have you on my team."
这不是沈青儿吗？你怎么会徘徊在潘多拉的梦境里？,Aren't you Sim Cheong? What brings you to Pandora's realm?
巴里？！我真没想到能在这儿遇上你。,Bari?! I didn’t expect to meet you here.
啊，我明白了，这又是你的新生意吗，潘多拉？,"Hmm... I see what you're up to, Pandora. Are you making a business out of this? Trading your help for favors?"
呵呵……你可真了解我，巫女殿下，有兴趣帮帮忙吗？,Hehe… You really know me well. Are you interested in helping out?
这次我就勉强答应你了——不过这可是看在沈青儿的份上。,"Alright, but only for Sim Cheong's sake."
哎？！这就答应了？按照往日，你不是都要测试一下对方的实力才同意吗？,Really?! But don't you always demand a test of strength before agreeing to help?
架是一定要打的，不过嘛，无论如何我都会帮这个忙的。,"A fight is a given. But I'll help out either way, since she is a dear friend."
你就好好感谢我吧，潘多拉，哼哼。,As for you Pandora... let's just say you owe me one.
虽然我输了，但你们得承认，以目前的团队实力来看，我们还很难对抗强大的神明。,"You may have beaten me, but even together, we won't stand a chance against the powerful gods we'll encounter here. Our party needs more strength."
这也正是我所担心的，接下来的路可能不太好走。,That’s exactly what I’m worried about. The road ahead won't be easy.
我相信只要团结，就能克服任何麻烦。,"I believe that as long as we stick together, we can overcome any trouble."
话倒没错，亲爱的。,"You are right, my dear. But we should still take steps to prepare."
幸好，还有个备用方案——我认识一个强悍的大家伙。,"Fortunately, I have a plan. And it involves a formidable dragon."
你是说……她？如果你真能说服她来帮忙，那我们的旅途将会顺利很多。,"You mean… Storm Dragon? Our journey would be much easier with her on our team. That is, if you can actually convince her to help."
她以前曾在东方呆过很长时间，后来留在了北欧神域，让我去和她聊聊吧……,"There she is. Let me go talk to her. We used to know each other back when she lived in Asia, before she moved to the Norse realm."
巴里，几千年未见了……这位年轻姑娘是？,"Bari, long time no see… Who is this young lady?"
沈青儿，东方众神中的新星，她的子民有难，而我打算带她去昆仑梦境，找西王母碰碰运气。,"This is Sim Cheong, the rising star of the Eastern gods. Her people are in trouble, and I plan to take her to the Kunlun Dreamland to seek Xiwangmu’s help."
我明白了，你们想要我加入你们，一同护送她吧？,I see. So you want me to join you in escorting her?
没错。,We would appreciate that.
我可以帮你们，但是……沈青儿，我需要测试你。,"I can help you, but first… Sim Cheong, I need to test you."
你需要我做什么？,What do you want me to do?
直面我的风暴，让我看看你的决心。,I want to see if you have enough determination to weather my storm.
我是不会退缩的。,Nothing you can unleash will break my will.
虽然你实力有限，但意志出奇地坚韧……你值得拥有拯救子民的荣耀。,"Despite your feeble frame, your will is surprisingly strong."
我会在接下来的旅途中保护你，为你披荆斩棘。,I will protect you on your journey and clear the way for you.
非常感谢您的帮助。,Thank you very much.
看来西王母猜得没错，你们果然在这儿。,It seems that Xiwangmu was right. You are indeed here.
你是……？,You are…?
火神祝融，在昆仑神域的梦境里见到她我可一点也不意外。,She is the fire goddess Zhu Rong. I’m not surprised to see her in the Kunlun Dreamland.
西王母手上有能够治愈万疾的仙药，但从不轻易给予他人。,"Xiwangmu has an elixir that can cure all diseases, but she does not give it to just anyone."
真糟糕，你不会是来阻止我们的吧？,How selfish! Are you here to stop us?
恰恰相反，我是个热心肠，如果你们连我这关都过不了，不如趁早回去，能省不少力气。,"On the contrary, I’m a kind-hearted person. First you must pass my test, to prove that your journey won't be a waste of time."
而如果你们能胜我，我就会在接下来的旅程中帮助你们。,"And if you do beat me, I will lend you my aid."
亲爱的，你觉得怎么样？,"Dear, what do you think?"
我会拯救我的子民，无论遇到什么样的困难。,"I will save my people, no matter what difficulties I must face."
那就上吧，时间可没多少能浪费了。,Then let's do this. Your people can't wait forever.
够了够了，再打我就要“过热”了。,"Enough, enough. I think we can stop right here."
西王母托我在这里接应你们，以防你们被某些盗药的家伙盯上。,Xiwangmu asked me to meet you here and help you just in case you ran into trouble on the road. There are thieves roaming about.
诶？原来你不是来考验我们的吗？,Huh? So you weren’t here to test us?
哼，和你们打一场只是餐后活动而已。,"I wanted to see what was so special about you, that made Xiwangmu want to help you."
昆仑神域居然还有人敢偷药？,So what are the thieves after? Do they dare try to steal the medicine in Kunlun realm?
非常遗憾，不久前还真有人得手了……也罢，不谈这些了。,"Unfortunately, they've already succeeded not too long ago. But let's not talk about that now."
接下来，就由我护送你们前往昆仑神域的顶峰吧。,"First, I need to focus on escorting you to the peak of Kunlun realm."
你们终于来了。,You finally made it.
嫦娥？你怎么也在这？,Chang’e? What are you doing here?
我？我当然是受命于西王母，在这里等着考验前来问药之人的。,"Me? I’m here on Xiwangmu’s orders, to test those who come for the medicine."
真麻烦……东方众神的考验，未免太多了点吧。,"What a hassle… You Eastern Gods do like testing everyone, don't you?"
你们看着我干什么？我先前只是开个玩笑，可没真打算阻拦你们。,"Why are you looking at me? I was just joking before, I didn’t really intend to stop you."
有话之后再聊，看招啦！,"She may have been joking, but I'm not. Let's see if you're worthy of this special medicine."
停手停手！真是一群暴力的家伙……你们通过测试了。,"Stop, stop! You have passed the test."
那就请您为我们带路吧。,Then please lead the way to Xiwangmu. We must see her urgently.
请跟我来吧。,Please follow me.
辉夜，她们来了。,"Kaguya, they’re here."
知道了，需要我的帮忙吗？,I see them. Do you need my help?
不用，这将会是一场公平的较量。,"No, I can deal with them on my own."
哟，这不是卑弥呼大人和辉夜阁下吗？你们出现在这里，难道是……,Lady Himiko? Princess Kaguya? What are you doing here?
我们在此的理由和你一样，也是为仙药而来，但我们之间必须决一胜负。,The same reason as you. We need the medicine of Kunlun.
一决胜负？！为什么？,Why are you trying to stop us?
据我所知，这种珍贵的仙药需经过几千年的炼制，世间仅存一份。,"From what I know, the medicine is very difficult to make, and thieves stole the last batch. We were here first, and we need the medicine more than you. The next one is ours!"
等等！就没有别的办法吗？,Wait! We can settle this another way.
亮出武器吧。,Draw your weapons!
呼……我失败了，辉夜，拜托你了……,"I can't hold out any longer. Kaguya, I need your help!"
我一定不会辜负日出之国的人民。,I won’t let down you down!
接下来，我将成为你们的对手！,Now you'll face me!
辉夜小姐，请不要勉强自己。,"Princess Kaguya, please don’t push yourself too hard."
对不起，仙药我必须要得到，不然整个高天原，都将彻底迎来毁灭。,"I must get the elixir, or else the whole heavenly realm will face destruction."
……不管怎么样，我一定要试试，来吧！,So... Come on!
咳咳……命运已经放弃大和众神了吗……,*Cough cough* Has fate abandoned the gods of Yamato…?
就没有两全其美的办法吗？我不想看到衰亡降临在任何人身上……,Isn’t there a way to make everyone happy? I don’t want to see anyone suffer…
如果能让更多的生命得救，让我付出什么样的代价都行，哪怕牺牲自己。,"I’m willing to pay any price to save more lives, even if it means sacrificing myself."
恐怕……,"Cheong, I don't think that's an option..."
沈青儿，你有这样的仁慈之心，我非常欣慰。,"You have a kind heart, Sim Cheong. I am very pleased."
西王母阁下？,Lady Xiwangmu?
话不用多说了，你们跟我来吧。,There’s no need for more words. Follow me.
沈青儿，如果你想寻求仙药，那么接下来必须通过最终的考验。,"Sim Cheong, if you want the elixir, you must pass the final test."
你刚刚说，为了求药愿意牺牲自己，是真的吗？,You just said that you are willing to sacrifice yourself for the elixir. Is that true?
我明白这很难，但……但为了众生，我愿意这样。,"I know it's hard, but yes. For the sake of all living beings, I am willing to do it."
这药需要以神明的灵魂做为素材才能发挥效果，这意味着测试者需要面对另一个自己。,"Well then listen closely. To make the elixir, a goddess must pour all of her divinity into it. In doing so, she must face her inner self. Even I have nearly lost myself in this process a few times."
而在面对自己时一旦因恐惧而放弃，轻则丧失神格，重则一命呜呼，你可有此觉悟？,"If you surrender to fear, you will either lose your divinity or die. That is why the elixir is so rare and difficult to make. Are you prepared to take this risk?"
我已经做好准备了……,I think I'm ready.
这梦境会召唤你的幻影，她将与你战斗直至一方被彻底消灭……,"Alright. Once you pour your divinity into this, a phantom of yourself will be summoned into this Dreamland. You must fight until one of you is completely destroyed…"
……你如能成功，幻影将替代你的灵魂，作为激活仙药的素材。,"...If you succeed, the phantom will be used to activate the elixir instead of your soul."
我不会畏惧的，来吧。,"Let's do this. For the sake of my people, I will not have any fear!"
一切尽归天命……,Good luck.
……结束了吗？,…Is it over?
虽然生死一线，但你成功了。,Yes. You put your life on the line and you succeeded.
这份仙药已经能够消除一切衰亡之灾，带着它回去救治你的子民吧。,This elixir can remedy any disease. Take it and go back to heal your people.
等等，这是否意味着大和的众生……,"Wait, does this mean that the people of Yamato…"
非常遗憾，仙药只有一份……,"I’m sorry, but there is only one elixir…"
天下生命没有贵贱之别，我……不愿意看到其他人遭受苦难，有什么办法吗？,I value all lives equally. I... don't want to see others suffer. Is there not another way?
高天原所遭受的衰亡之灾，源于黄泉之神伊邪那美的诅咒。,"Yamato is suffering due to the curse of Izanami, the goddess of the underworld."
倘若她愿意让诅咒停止，那么仙药也并非必须，但你知道面对她的代价吗？,"If she is willing to dispel the curse, then the elixir is not necessary. But Izanami... She is much more powerful than me or any other gods you have met."
抱歉，辉夜……我不能在此牺牲，这个代价或许太过沉重。,"I’m sorry, Kaguya… I can’t sacrifice myself here. My people need me."
不用过于自责，我们也需要面对这份命运。,Don’t blame yourself. This is not your duty.
大和众神也会坚定地完成自己的使命，就如你一样。,We will not forget your good intentions.
沈青儿，我将帮你打开离开梦境的传送门，去拯救你的子民吧，时间不多了……,"Sim Cheong, I will help you open the portal to leave the dream. Go and save your people. There’s not much time left…"
我明白，即便是灵魂坠落黄泉，我也会面对她！,"I understand. Even if I have to risk falling into the underworld, I will face her!"
我将连接伊邪那美的梦境，但之后会发生什么我就不敢保证了。,"I will connect to Izanami’s dream, but I can’t guarantee what will happen next."
仁慈的少女，愿天照大神的光芒赐福于你，一切请小心……,"Kind girl, may the light of Amaterasu bless you. Be careful…"
辉夜，我已知晓你们到来的意图……,"Kaguya, I already know why you have come..."
伊邪那美阁下，无论是何原因，我恳请您收回对高天原的诅咒。,"Lady Izanami, whatever the reason for your curse, I beg you to lift it."
我感受到灵魂在腐朽，道义在消逝，生命将终归黄泉……,"Souls decay, morality fades, and all life returns to the underworld in the end."
我不过是让这一切早些到来而已。,I’m just making it happen sooner.
不，万事万物都遵循自然之法，他们命运还没有结束。,"No, everything happens in its own time. Fate is not yours to control."
异邦的少女……你说得不错，但强存弱死也是自然法则的一环。,Outsider... Who are you to question me?
作为黄泉之主，我有义务践行此理。,"As ruler of the underworld, I have absolute authority over all lives."
那么身为生命的守护者，我也将与众神一同阻止您……,"Then as a guardian of life, I will stop you!"
有趣……如果你们在战斗中胜过我，我便收回诅咒。,"Big words for such a weak little girl. You don't stand a chance! But if by some miracle you win, I will lift my curse."
但如果你们失败了，我便取走你们所有人的灵魂，如何？,"And if you fail, I will take your soul. Do you still dare to oppose me?"
我们准备好了，请开始吧……,I'm not afraid of you. This ends now!
呵呵……真是意外，没想到我最终会输给你们……,What a surprise. Defeated by such weakling...
您并没有使出全力，我可以感觉到……,You didn’t use your full strength. I can feel it…
哼……或许命运今天站在你们一边吧，我会遵守约定，消除所有的诅咒。,Hmph… Maybe fate is on your side today. I will keep my promise and remove the curse.
感谢您理解这一切……,Finally... The suffering will end for the people of Yamato!
至于你……异邦的少女，我会在未来好好留意你的。,"As for you, outsider, I will keep my eye on you in the future."
因为我对你纯洁的灵魂很感兴趣，我期待在黄泉与你相见的那天，呵呵……,"A soul as pure as yours will surely be delicious. I look forward to the day we meet again, in the underworld, little girl."

潘~多~拉！,Pan~do~ra!
坏了，好像有什么麻烦精找上门来了，我得赶紧开溜。,Oh no! It seems trouble has come knocking at my door.
你说谁是麻烦呀？,Who are you calling trouble?
没事，我说自己呢……你来找我有什么事情吗？,"I, um... I was speaking about myself. Definitely not you... So why are you here?"
出大事了！月亮被人偷走了！,It's a disaster! Someone stole the moon!
月亮被人偷走了？那……好像挺严重的样子啊，会有什么危害吗？,Did you say the MOON was stolen? That... is quite bad.
我的家没啦！人们也不能赏月了，海水不会涨潮了，依赖月亮生存的动物也会受到影响！,"Without the moon, the tides won't change and people will suffer."
那你有线索吗？,Do you have any clue how this happened?
有线索了人家才不会来找你呢。,I wouldn't be here if I did. That's why I need your help.
说得我好像是什么邪神似的……好了，按照规则，对梦境有所求者，必须通过我的考验。,"Well, if you want my help traversing the dreamland, you must pass my test."
好呀好呀，我最近在王母娘娘那学了几个新招，正愁找不到人试试手。,Perfect. It gives me a chance to try out the new tricks Xiwangmu taught me.
……你当我是个陪练吗？,...Are you suggesting that I'm nothing more than a punching bag?
好了好了，停手，让你的兔子从我头上离开，弄乱了我的发型！,"Okay okay, stop. Get your bunny off my head! It's making a nest in my hair."
嘻嘻，回来吧小玉。,"Hehe. Come back, Little Jade."
我需要占卜一下来确认月亮的大致去向。,Let's see. I will use divination to find out what happened.
……我看到一只巨大的黑影将它吞了下去。,...I saw a huge black shadow swallowing the moon.
是天狗！,It's the Heavenly Dog!
什么是天狗？,What's that?
它是华夏传说中巨大的黑狗，可以吞掉一切发光的东西。,"It's a big black dog from Chinese legends, which swallows shiny things."
它长什么样子？就是一条巨大的狗吗？,What does it look like? Just a big dog?
我也没见过……都只是听说的。,I haven't seen it myself. I've only heard about it.
大和神族对天狗的纪录倒是挺多的，我看要不去问问她们。,We should ask the knowledgable Yamato gods. Maybe they know more.
辉夜阁下，好久不见啦。,"Long time no see, Princess Kaguya."
……你，你是谁？,Who's there?
我是嫦娥啊，你的眼睛怎么回事？怎么灰蒙蒙的？,It's Chang'e. What happened to your eyes?
我，什么也看不到……看不到月光，也看不到你。,"I can't see anything... Not the moon, nor you."
恐怕是因为月亮消失的原因，让她暂时性的失明了。,This must be because of the moon's disappearance.
我……啊！月亮消失了，我内心的月魔要苏醒了！你们……你们快离开这里！,I-... ah. Oh no! The moon demon inside me is waking up. Get away from me quickly!
不用害怕，那种东西不存在的哦，只是你内心另一面而已，就像月亮暗面一样。,"Calm down, there's no such thing as a moon demon. It's just another side of you, like the dark side of the moon."
我快控制不住了……,No... I can't control it anymore...
那就释放它吧，我们会拯救你。,Then release it. We will defeat it to save you.
谢谢你们，我感觉好多了。,Thank you. I feel better now.
看来月亮的消失确实对很多人造成了影响。,It seems the moon's disappearance really is affecting people.
辉夜妹妹，你的心魔并没有完全除去，月亮消失的越久，心魔就会出现的越频繁。,"Princess Kaguya, your inner demon isn't gone. Without the moon, it will keep appearing."
那该怎么办？,What should I do?
不如跟我们一起去把月亮找回来，这样你就不用忍受心智被剥夺的痛苦了。,Why don't you join us to get the moon back?
我愿意加入你们，一起追回月亮！,Of course I will join you!
不是我有意讽刺，就你们俩，恐怕还不够那个“天狗”塞牙缝的。,"I hate to burst your bubble, but the two of you would be nothing more than a snack for that Dog."
这不还有你嘛。,What about you?
我？要是太过危险，我肯定第一个跑。,Me? I'm running at the first sign of danger.
你得找个更厉害的家伙当靠山。,"If you want to stand a chance, you need someone stronger."
这么说得话，我倒是想到有个人会帮我。,"In that case, I know someone who might help."
嗯哼？,Who?
火神祝融！她可是华夏神族鼎鼎有名的战神！最主要的是，她还欠我一顿饭！,"Fire Goddess Zhu Rong! She's the Chinese Goddess of War. And most importantly, she owes me a favor."
这么说你是有把握说服她来帮我们咯？那么走吧，我带你们去见她。,"Well if you're confident you can convince her, I will take you to her."
好了，咱们到了，剩下的就得靠你自己争取了。,Here we are. I brought you to Zhu Rong. The rest is up to you.
诸位来找在下，所为何事？,You were looking for me?
嫦娥仙子？你怎么来了？,Chang'e? Why are you here?
出大事啦，月亮不见了！,Please help! The moon has disappeared!
月亮不见了？这是怎么回事？,The moon disappeared? What happened?
那只传说中的天狗把月亮给吞掉了！请你帮帮我，一起去把它追回来。,It was swallowed by the legendary Heavenly Dog. Please help me get it back.
我明白了，不过我这会和人约了决斗呢，恐怕不能帮你。,"I see, but... I have an appointment for a duel, so I can't come with you."
决斗？为什么要决斗？和谁？,A duel? Why?
哎呀就是闲着无聊，想找人打一架。,"Ugh, because I'm bored. I've been itching for a fight."
我陪你打！,Then I will fight you!
什么？就你？别开玩笑了吧。,You? Hah!
人家可是很厉害的，而且人家还有两个帮手哦。,Don't underestimate me and my allies.
好吧好吧，就当正式比试前的热身。,I guess I could do with a warm-up.
诶，不错嘛，你这几下子是谁教你的？,Not bad. You've improved.
嘻嘻，不告诉你！好啦，是王母娘娘教我的。,Xiwangmu has been teaching me.
娘娘真偏心，等回去了我也要让她教我。,"Xiwangmu has taught you some interesting moves. When I return, I'll ask her to teach me, too."
那你现在愿意和我一起追月亮了吗？,So are you willing to look for the moon with me now?
好吧，反正这一架也让我稍微有点满足了，就陪你去逛逛吧。,"Well since gave me a satisfying fight, I wouldn't mind stretching my legs a bit... I'm in."
那么接下来去哪？辉夜姬，你知道关于天狗的事情吗？,"So where to next? Princess Kaguya, what do you know about the Heavenly Dog?"
我知道的不多，但是我认识一个人是这方面的专家，我可以带你们去她那看看。,Not much. But I can take you to someone who is well-versed in this kind of thing.
那就请你带路吧。,Lead the way.
好漂亮的神社啊，这里一定住着一位法力强大的巫女。,What a beautiful shrine. There must be a powerful priestess living here.
而且她长得还很美。,She is also very beautiful.
抱歉各位，神社今日闭馆了，如果想要求签的话还请改日再来。,"Sorry, the shrine is closed today. If you're looking for a fortune telling, please come back another day."
巫女，我们是来寻求帮助的。,"Amaterasu, we've come for your help."
辉夜公主？抱歉，我刚刚看走眼了，还以为你们是普通的客人。,"Princess Kaguya? I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was you."
那么究竟是什么事情需要我的帮助呢？,What do you need my help with?
我们遇到一件很麻烦的事：月亮被天狗给吞下去了。,The moon was swallowed by the Heavenly Dog.
天狗？您说的应该是华夏传说里的吞噬日月的天狗吧。,You mean the Heavenly Dog from Chinese legends? The one which devours the sun and moon?
没错，就是这个家伙。,That's the one.
我对这个只是略有涉猎，我需要占卜一下。,"Although I have only dabbled a bit in divination, let me try find it for you."
我看到一头黑色的野兽……但我看不清它的面貌……,I can see... a black beast... but it's too shadowy to make out...
唔…………,Let me try... Ah!
你怎么啦？,What's wrong?
当心，她被什么附身了。,"Wait, don't touch her! She's been possessed by something..."
哼哼，我倒要好好看看，是谁妄想用占卜来监视我的尊身！,Hmph. I came to get a look at who would dare to spy on me.
这不是潘多拉嘛，怎么着，又在干帮小狗狗找妈妈的活呢。,"And who do I find, but Pandora. Are you helping lost children find their way again?"
看来你认识我，那想必我也认识你咯。不如现身来见我吧，别躲躲藏藏的了。,"You have me at a disadvantage. You know me, but I don't know you. Why don't you reveal yourself?"
啊哈哈哈，那多没趣啊，我要用这副躯壳将你们都打趴下了，再考虑这个提议。,Haha that's too boring! Instead I'm going to destroy you all using this body.
别打了！她已经恢复神智了！,Stop! She's regained her sanity.
……我刚刚怎么了？身体好痛，好像被人打过……,Ouch. What happened? And why do I feel like I was beaten up?
抱歉，刚刚有个鬼鬼祟祟的家伙附上你的身，我们被迫把它打走了，对，被迫……,Well... Someone sneaky took over your body and we had no choice but to fight you. No choice at all...
呃……,Uh huh...
你刚才看到什么了？,What did you see?
我看到了一只巨大的野兽，它的样子很难描述……我看到它身边有一群猫。,I saw a huge beast. I don't know how to describe it. But I did see cats surrounding it.
猫？难道是……猫又？不可能，她那么可爱，怎么会做出这种事情呢？何况她没有那种力量。,Cats? Could it be... Nekomata? But she's too cute to do such a thing.
不如我们先去找她问问？,Let's go ask her ourselves.
嘿喵嘿喵，真好吃，这可比小鱼干好吃啊喵！,A-meow-zing! This is so delicious.
我决定，得空了再去整点……唔，最好下个月的供奉都拿来换这个吃！,It's even better than dried fish. It was worth it to exchange all the offerings for this!
啊！你在吃什么？快把它放下！,What are you eating? Bad kitty! Give it here.
什么啊喵，又有人和本喵抢吃的喵！看本喵不痛扁你喵！,You're stealing meow food! Hiss! I won't let you!
别打了别打了喵！好吃的给你们，都给你们！喵！,"Ow! Stop hitting meow! Here, here, you can have some."
等等，这不是月亮！？,Wait what's this!? This isn't the moon!
什么月亮啊喵，这是章鱼小丸子！,What meow-n? This is octopus balls!
章……什么？,Octo- what now?
章鱼小丸子！是食物啊喵！,Octopus balls! Food! Meow food!
她好像在护食……真可爱！好想抱一抱啊！,"How cute! She's protecting her food. I just wanna hug her, she's so cute!"
你别过来啊喵！本喵不要被抱……唔，唔，只准摸本喵的头哦……呼噜呼噜。,No hugging! Um... but you can pet meow head. Purr~fect.
虽然猫口夺食可恶，但看你们诚心服侍本喵的情况下就原谅你们了喵。,"Stealing meow food was claw-ful, but I will forgive you since you petted meow head."
所以你们来找本喵到底是为了什么事情？,Why were you looking for meow?
是这样的，月亮被一只大狗样子的怪物给吞下去了！,We're looking for a big black dog that swallowed the moon.
本喵不明白，月亮被狗吃了你们倒是去找狗啊，来找本喵这只猫干什么喵？,"...I know I have a tail and ears, but you do realize that I'm a cat, right?"
话是这么说，但我们在它身边看到了猫，所以就想来问问你。,Well a divination revealed cats surrounding it.
那没必要抢本喵吃的吧……,That's no reason to grab meow food.
话说本喵前不久一直和熊女在一块，她长得倒是挺像狗的，胃口也那么大。,Hmm. I was with Ungnyeo earlier. She looks like a dog and has a big appetite.
任何线索都不能放过，那就麻烦小猫猫给我们带带路吧！,"We gotta follow any and every clue. Lead the way, kitty."
哼~哼~哼！今天又是好天气呀，小蜜蜂在哪里啊，在~哪~里？,"Hum~hum~ Such a lovely day today. Little bees~ Come out, come out, wherever you are."
快看，她就在那里！,Look! That's her.
咦，来了群人，该不会是来抢蜂蜜的吧？,Huh!? Why are so many people here? Maybe...to steal my honey!?
吓！是她们！我得赶紧开溜了！,No! I won't let them! I'll run away.
喂，你站住，别跑啊！,"Hey, stop, don't run!"
呜呜呜……你们为什么要追我？,Wah! Why are you chasing me?
那你为什么一看见我们就跑呀？,Why are you running?
你们一脸气势汹汹，我以为是要抢我的蜂蜜……而且还有潘多拉，每次见到她都没好事。,You all look scary. I thought you wanted to steal my honey. And Pandora always brings trouble.
她这副熊样，我看不像是能偷月亮的家伙……你们怎么看？,"She looks more like a bear than a dog. Unless the moon is honey, I don't think she's the one who ate it."
呃，确实，她看起来一点都不凶……即便显出真身的时候，也还是呆萌呆萌的样子。,Indeed. She doesn't look like a scary beast. She's actually really fluffy and cute!
偷月亮？偷什么月亮？,Steal the moon? Steal what moon?
月亮被天狗吞下了，但是我们都没见过天狗的样子，所以才错把你当成了那个坏蛋。,"The moon was swallowed by the Heavenly Dog. But none of us have seen it before, so..."
我是熊，又不是狗，虽然以前也有人叫我狗熊来着……,"I am a bear, not a dog."
如果世界上有能吞下月亮的家伙，我觉得应该会是龙族！只有她们才有那么大的胃口。,"If anyone could swallow the moon, it would be dragons! Only they have such a big appetite."
说得好像也对诶，但是天狗不是狗嘛？熊看起来还挺像狗，但龙和狗却毫无相似点啊。,"But aren't we looking for a dog? A bear looks a bit like a dog, but a dragon looks nothing like it."
天狗也不一定是狗，说不定是一种指代呢？就像大和神族的天狗神。,Maybe the Heavenly Dog is not actually a dog. That could just be its name.
唔，也有道理，那我们就去找龙吧！,Hmm. That is sound logic. Then let's go find ourselves a dragon!
这里好像是风暴之龙的捕猎场，我们这样直接闯进来真的好吗？,We're now in the hunting grounds of Storm Dragon. Will we really be okay breaking in like this?
别担心，就算被袭击了，祝融也会保护我们的，嘻嘻。,Don't worry. Zhu Rong will protect us. Hehe.
可别总是指望我，要是场面太混乱了，我不一定能保证你们所有人的安全。,"I will try, but I can't guarantee anything if it gets too dangerous."
没关系啦，说不定风暴之龙在睡觉呢！,It's okay. Storm Dragon is probably sleeping.
吼！！！,*ROAR!!*
啊！！什么声音？,Ahhh! What was that sound??
我怎么说来着？做好战斗准备吧，那家伙朝我们俯冲过来了！,I have a bad feeling about this... Watch out! Above us!
你们不是我的猎物……为什么要跑进我的猎场？,You're not my usual prey... What are you doing in my hunting grounds?
抱歉，风暴女士，我们是来找失踪的月亮的。,"Sorry, Storm Dragon. We came here in search of the moon."
失踪的月亮？,The moon?
没错，月亮被人偷走了，有个朋友说可能是龙族把它吃掉了。,"Yes, the moon was swallowed. And we heard from a little bear that maybe a dragon ate it."
龙？吃月亮？哈哈哈哈，我从来不知道谁的胃口有这么独特。,A dragon? Eating the moon? Haha even us dragons don't have such an appetite.
显然月亮的消失和龙族没有任何关系，你不如去月夜见尊那里看看吧，说不定她知道什么。,We have nothing to do with that. Maybe the moon goddess Tsukuyomi knows something.
好的，多谢你，风暴女士。,"Thank you, Lady Storm."
这里的气氛很不对劲，我感受到一股寒冷的力量占据了这里……就像是雪夜的月光。,"The atmosphere here is strange, it's very cold... Like moonlight on a snowy night."
那是……,That's...
……,...
她好像……可能……看样子是不会想和我们好好讲话了。,I don't think she's here to have a nice chat with us.
当心，她入魔了，准备战斗！,Watch out! She's possessed!
啊……感谢你们，让我重获清醒。,Thank you for bringing me back to my senses.
月夜大人，你为什么会变成这样？,"Tsukuyomi, what happened to you?"
自从月亮消失后，我的内心就被一股黑暗占据。,"Without the light of the moon, my heart was consumed by darkness."
月夜见尊，你知道是谁偷走了月亮吗？真的是天狗作祟吗？,Do you know who stole the moon? Was it really the Heavenly Dog?
抱歉，嫦娥仙子，我并不知道是谁偷走了月亮。,"Unfortunately I don't know, Chang'e."
如果真的有天狗吞月的话， 恐怕只有埃及的阿努比斯神能做到这点了。,But if it's a dog that swallowed the moon... maybe... Anubis?
可是她不是胡狼神吗？,The Egyptian Goddess of the Underworld? But isn't she the Jackal Goddess?
胡狼也是大狗狗！,Jackals are just desert dogs!
嗅~嗅嗅~你们好像不是亡者。既然没死，来我这里干什么？,Sniff sniff~ You don't smell dead. Why have the living come to see me?
嫦娥仙子，恕我直言，她长得和我占卜时看到的家伙也不太一样。,"Chang'e, she doesn't look like the beast I saw."
哪里不一样？,What is different?
她看起来……有点可爱……,She looks... kind of cute...
……好像确实有一点。,...I see what you mean.
你们在那里嘀嘀咕咕什么呢？,What are you mumbling about over there?
我们是来寻找月亮的，它被一条巨大的天狗给偷走了。,We're here to find the moon. It was swallowed by the Heavenly Dog.
天狗？你看我长得像是会偷月亮的狗吗？,The Heavenly Dog? Are you saying I look like a dog? And swallowed the moon?
不好说……,Hard to say...
确实……,Really hard...
看来你们还真是无礼呢，哼！,How rude!
得给你们点小小得教训。,I will teach you some manners.
好呀，既然要打架，那么即便你没有偷月亮，一会也要你吐一个出来！,I'm going to make you spit out the moon!
怎么样，还要打吗？我可要放狗了！,"Well? If you want to fight more, I will let the dogs out!"
好了好了，我相信你不是那个偷月亮的了——你身上确实没有月亮的气息。,"Alright, alright. I believe you, you didn't swallow the moon."
虽然都为犬类，但我可不爱乱吃东西。,"Although I am also a canine, I don't eat strange things."
说到偷走月亮，我确实知道一点点消息……,"Well, if it's about swallowing the moon, I might know something.."
有个叫做阿佩普的家伙喜欢乱吃东西，连埃及的天空都被她吞过。,There is someone who likes to eat things. Apep the Devourer. She even swallowed the sky of Egypt once.
最近她好像又从哪吞了一个发光的东西，我猜，大概就是月亮吧。,"A little while ago, she swallowed something shiny. I guess it's probably the moon."
我要在哪里能够找到她呢？,Where can I find her?
你确定真的要面对她吗？,Are you sure you want to face her?
一路走来，你的力量已经有不少成长了，如果被她一口吞下，你的一切都将化为乌有。,"You have gained much strength during your journey. If she swallows you, you will be reduced to nothing."
那么如你所愿了，我将召唤阿佩普。,As you wish. I will summon Apep.
吞噬一切的混沌啊，我以死者的庇护者之名召唤你，来到我的面前……,"O all-consuming chaos. In the name of the Guardian of the Dead, I summon you..."
哎呀哎呀，原来是阿努比斯啊。,"Well well, if it isn't Anubis."
好久不见了呢，是又给我送祭品来了吗？这次是狗还是鳄鱼呢？,It's been a long time. Have you brought me another sacrifice?
不好意思，我可没功夫打理你，是这几位，来找你讨要她们丢掉的东西了。,I don't have time for you. They are here to get back what you stole.
没错，就是你这家伙！快把月亮还给我们！,You! Give us back the moon!
哦？你说的就是那个发光的大白球吗？好啊？想要的话，就打败我吧。,Oh? Are you talking about that big shiny white ball? You'll have to beat me if you want it back.
你比我想象中的更坚韧，小姑娘。这个大白球就还给你好了，反正也没那么好吃。,"You're tougher than I thought, little girl. I'll return this ball to you. It wasn't that tasty anyway."
太好了，这下子月亮就可以重回天际了。,Now the moon can return to the sky.
到时候那些以为月亮的消失而迷失的大伙们，又可以过上正常的生活了。,Everyone's lives can return to normal.
看起来你升华了，嫦娥——月亮的力量现在与你融为一体，你将晋升为新的月神。,"Chang'e, the power of the moon is now within you. You've become the new moon goddess."
真的吗？好像是哦……以后我将更加努力为了大家照亮黑暗中的天空！,Really? Oh I feel it. I will work hard to light up the night sky for everyone!
很好，我已经为你打开了回去的路，跟着我的胡狼，你就不会迷失回去的路。,"Very well, I have opened the way back for you. Follow my jackal."
月亮是我们所有人的依靠，我必须要找回它，哪怕是付出我的一切！,"So many depend on the moon. I have to get it back, even if it costs me everything!"
你说的对，那种能够吞下天空的家伙不是我能对付的，我应该回去禀报王母。,You are right. Someone who can swallow the sky is not something I can deal with. I should go back and report to Xiwangmu.

真是意外呢，看来这个秘境能通往众神的国度。,"Amazing! This tunnel must connect to a secret realm, maybe a long lost kingdom of the gods."
好激动好激动，我们赶紧去看看吧,I am so excited! Let's go and see what we can find there!
呼呼，累死我了，没想到这秘境里面这么大。不过运气不错，快看看我找到了什么宝贝！,"I'm exhausted. I didn't expect this place to be so big. But look, I found these!"

以纯金打造的金字塔复制品，它们很小，小到只用一只手就能拿起。如此精巧的复制品，让人不禁产生怀疑，它的内部，是否也躺着一位法老王呢？,These pyramid replicas small enough to hold in one hand are made of pure gold. People often wonder if these delicate replicas were concealed inside the mummified remains of pharaohs.
据说是使用女娲补填用的神石磨出来的石镜。石镜中精确的刻着日月星辰的方位，仿佛宇宙间的一切，都被收入其中。,"It is said that this stone mirror is made of the sacred stone Nuwa used to mend heaven. The exact positions of the sun, moon, and stars are engraved upon it, indicating that the entire universe is contained within it."
耀眼无比，华丽绝伦的项链。传说它可能是由珍珠制成的。可以使穿戴的女性更加美丽，使男人都无法抗拒。这个项链是女神弗蕾亚的宝物，平时绝不离身。,"A dazzling, gorgeous necklace. It is said to be made of luxurious pearls, shimmering gems of the sea renowned for their beauty and rarity. Legend has it that wearing this enchanting talisman will imbue its bearer with an irresistible allure, a radiance so captivating that no man can resist her charms. The necklace was the treasure of Freyja, and she would never go anywhere without it."
埃及金字塔守护者象征物所制的神圣收藏品，埃及王权的象征。通体为黄金和宝石打造，凝视它时，仿佛也感到了它的回视。,"This elaborate artifact, made from gold and gemstones, is a symbol of protection and well-being. It once belonged to the Egyptian god of kingship. Staring at it may give one the eerie feeling that it is staring back at you."
据说是基督受刑时，用来盛放他的血液的金杯。为了向世人证明基督非神，于是将他的血液盛起来，而神是不会流血的。,This elusive gold cup purportedly has miraculous healing powers and the ability to grant immortality.
希伯来神话中存放摩西十诫的、最为神圣的宝物。如此精巧的工艺，到底出自和人之手，无从得知。,This blessed treasure made of wood and covered in gold is said to contain sacred stone tablets. Its craftsmanship is exquisite.
它是由火山之心的熔岩打造出来的宝剑，火焰巨人苏特尔曾挥舞此剑，在彩虹桥上大杀四方，据说他挥出的每一剑，都能点燃一方的天空。,"The sword, crafted from the molten lava at the heart of a volcano, was once wielded by the fire giant Surtr, who ravaged his enemies in battle on the Rainbow Bridge. Legend has it that each swing of the sword could ignite parts of the sky, leaving a trail of flames in its wake."
又名“斯基德普拉特尼”，是北欧神工匠侏儒所制，送给弗雷的一艘飞船，大可装下所有北欧众神，小可放至口袋中，诸神黄昏发生时搭载众神至战场的宝物。,"Skidbladnir is a magnificent ship crafted by a skilled Nordic dwarf for Freyr, the god of fertility and sunlight. It is capable of carrying all the Nordic gods at once, yet it can also be folded and stored in a pocket. This divine vessel is a treasured means of transportation for the gods, carrying them into battle during the fateful Twilight of the Gods."
由昊天大帝所铸，赠予禹王用来支撑东海的基柱，名为定海神针，巨大，且奇重无比。昊天上帝为了使禹王等凡夫俗子能够移动，故施加”如意“咒法，念此咒，可将其自由放大缩小。,"Forged by Emperor Haotian, it was given to King Yu to support the pillar of the East Sea. It was huge and incredibly heavy, called the Divine Needle of the Settled Sea. In order to enable King Yu and other mortals to move it, the Emperor of the Skies applied a wish-fulfilling spell, which, when recited, could freely enlarge or shrink it."

书中自有黄金屋，书中自有颜如玉，你说对吗？,"In books there are houses of gold, in books there are beauties of jade. Do you agree?"
一起去钓鱼吗？以为的能力，你想钓多大的都可以哦,How about we go fishing together? You can catch as big as you wish with your skill.
这么好的天气，一起去冲浪吧，今天就不打铁了。,"What a nice weather, let’s go surfing together, I don’t need to work on iron today."
这世上敢如此直视我的眼睛的人可不多见呢！我承认，我开始对你有点兴趣了。,"You are one of the few people in this world who can meet my gaze without flinching! I confess, you have piqued my curiosity."
主人，要吃些我做的甜品吗？,"Master, would you like to try some desserts I made?"
这种樱花盛开的季节最适合去狩猎了，你说呢？,"This is the best time to hunt when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom, don’t you think?"
欢迎光临，想喝点什..什么吗...嗯？你是来找我的？,"Welcome, what can I get you…hmm? Are you looking for me?"
许个愿吧！兴许我能帮你实现呢。,Make a wish! Maybe I can make it come true.

生命钥匙,Key of Life
神王奥丁的至宝之一，刻于石板上的符文。这是一种蕴含着魔力的文字，传说每个字节都代表着一种自然能量，当它们组成词语或者短句时，就能形成一个魔法。,Runestones were one of the supreme treasures of the god Odin. Runes written on stone slab harbored great magic and represented natural energy. Spells were created when these runes formed words or short sentences.
由黄金和宝石打造，象征生命和轮回的十字型法器。它是法老王发号施令的工具，也是祭司们与亡灵沟通的圣物。,This symbol of life is a cross-shaped magical object made of gold and precious stones. The gods once gifted the pharaohs with this powerful symbol.
潘多拉！,Pandora!
这不是双子星吗？怎么想起来找我了？,Gemini? This is a surprise.
请你帮帮我们，帮帮我的妹妹。,Please help us. Help my sister.
究竟是怎么了？,What's wrong?
在我沉睡时，她引发了一场星座间的巨大混乱……,"While I was sleeping, she created chaos among the the Zodiac Signs."
接着就变成这样了——一言不发，好像整个灵魂都被抽走了一样。,"And then suddenly, her soul vanished from her body! She hasn't spoken a word since!"
让我看看……嗯，她的意识好像陷入了沉睡之中。,"From the looks of her, she seems to be in a very deep state of sleep."
没错，你能帮帮我吗？,Can you help?
没问题，不过找我帮忙可以要付出代价的……,"Yes, but only at a price."
我愿意付出任何代价来救我的妹妹，秘密与求知的女神！,"To save my sister, I will pay any price you ask, Goddess of Secrets and Knowledge!"
秘密与求知的女神……呵呵，这美妙的称呼我可几百年没听到了，心情不错，就帮帮你好了！,"Hehe, I haven't heard that title in centuries. I'm in a good mood, so I'll help you."
不过按照规则，我需要先测试你的力量是否强大到能抵御梦境中的危险。,"However, I must first test your strength to see if you're strong enough to survive the Dreamland. It's one of my rules."
单从战斗力来看，你能做到一个灵魂操纵两个肉体，也还不赖嘛。,"You handle yourself well in combat, especially for someone controlling two bodies with one soul."
呼……这其实很勉强，已经是我的全部力量了……,That actually pushed me to my limits.
我知道了，同为双生星座，我想双鱼座应该会对你的情况有所了解。,"I see. Maybe Pisces will have some insight. After all, her zodiac sign is also a twin."
潘多拉……？你今天看来挺闲的，平时可没见你有兴趣到其他人的梦境里转悠。,Pandora...? You must have a lot of free time to be wandering around in other people's dreams.
别开玩笑了，我时间紧得很，有个熟人来找你帮忙。,Don't joke around. I'm actually pressed for time. My acquaintance needs your help.
……,...
双子座？！对不起，我这里不欢迎你！,Gemini?! You're not welcome here after the havoc you've sown.
不，不是这样的，你误会了……,"Please, it's not what you think. There's been a misunderstanding."
如果你再不离开，我可就不客气了！,"Either leave now, or I'll kick you out by force."
潘多拉……你为什么也帮助她？她可是差一点毁掉整个黄道的家伙！,Pandora... why are you helping her? She almost destroyed the entire Zodiac!
抱歉了，她这次是我的委托人，能让她把话说完吗？,"I promised to help her. We made a deal. Now, will you let her finish what she was saying?"
好吧，看在你的份上，我就听听她的解释吧。,"...For your sake, I will listen."
双鱼座，之前星座间的骚乱并非我们的本意，黑暗之子好像失控了，才做了过分的事情。,"Pisces, what happened wasn't our intention. My sister lost control and things got out of hand."
而且她在离开黄道后，就变成了这样，好像丢失了灵魂一样。,"And afterwards, her body became like this. As if she'd lost her soul."
我怀疑有人在背后操控她，同为双生星座，你对她的情况有所了解吗？,"My suspicion is that someone is manipulating her. Pisces, you are both twin signs. Do you have any idea what may have happened to her?"
……不太清楚，我们的两个灵魂共用一个身体，从来没有遇到失控的情况。,"...I am not sure. Unlike Gemini, our two souls share one body, and neither one of us has ever lost control."
不过我知道一个人可能对此有研究——摩羯座，她以前是名为“潘”的大神。,"But I do know someone who might have an idea. Capricorn was once the goddess Pan. She once tried to change into a fish, but got stuck as both a goat and a fish."
是她？如果她还拥有曾经作为潘神时候的记忆和神力的话，或许可以帮助我们。,"Capricorn? If she still has Pan's memories and powers, then she might be able to help."
好久不见了！,"Long time no see, Capricorn."
姐妹，别来无恙。,"Sister, it is good to see you."
这位是潘多拉女神，而这两位……你应该见过。,"This is the goddess Pandora, and these two... Well, you know them."
双子？她身上有股不好的气息……,Gemini? Why do I sense a horrible aura around her?
不愧是所有星座中最敏锐的一个……你看出什么问题了吗？,You really are the most perceptive of all the Zodiac Signs. Can you see what's wrong with her?
她的的灵魂似乎沾染上了别的东西，但很朦胧，我看不清楚。,"Her soul is stained by something, but it's too hazy to see what is causing this influence."
如果我激发自己的力量，是否能放大影响力，让你看得更清楚些？,"If I draw on my power, would that amplify the influence and allow you to see the cause more clearly?"
这是个不错的方法，一场战斗会是个好选择。,That would work. And the best way to do that would be through battle.
她身上好像有股冥界的能量。,The evil energy seems to be coming from the underworld.
冥界？是哈迪斯那家伙吗？但她已经很久很久都没插手过众神之间的事了。,"The underworld? Is it Hades then? But she hasn't meddled in the affairs of the gods for a long, long time."
先不管那么多了，去问问她就知道了。,"She doesn't care about that stuff. Regardless, it seems we'll need to pay her a visit."
各位准备去哪？这样不经同意闯入别人的梦境，可不是什么礼貌的事情。,Where are you going? It's not polite to break into other people's dreams without consent.
抱歉，天后大人，我们现在还有正事要做。,"Sorry, but we have business we need to attend to."
正事？帮我修剪玫瑰园这种吗？,Business? Like pruning my roses?
别开玩笑了，那是您佣人该做的。,Hmph. That's something your servant should do.
都过去那么久了，没想到你对我还有成见呀。,"Even after all this time, you still think so little of me?"
对您这样喜怒无常的女神，我可喜欢不起来。,I don't like moody goddesses like you.
既然这样的话，不如我们来打个赌吧。,"In that case, why don't we make a bet?"
你们要是能在战斗中胜过我，就饶恕你们的无礼，而且我承诺帮你们完成“正事”。,"If you defeat me in battle, I will forgive your rudeness and I will even help you attend to your business."
但如果你们输了，那今天就拜托你们好好照顾照顾我的玫瑰园吧。,"But if you lose, then please take good care of my roses."
这可是你说的哦，来吧！,You'll regret those words! You're on!
看来今天我的玫瑰园是修不成了。,It seems that my rose pruning will have to have to wait for another day.
不过，我一向信守承诺……你们所谓的“正事”是什么？,"However, I always keep my word. So what is this business of yours?"
天后大人，我的妹妹似乎被冥界的力量操控了，我们想去找哈迪斯问问。,"My lady, my sister seems to be under the control of a power from the underworld. We want to ask Hades."
冥王可不欢迎任何我们这样的人闯入，如果要和她较量，必须找个能打的。,"Hades does not like intrusions from the likes of us. If you want to see her, you will need to find someone who can fight."
雅典娜应该是个不错的人选，我们去找她吧。,Might I suggest Athena? She is a good candidate.
雅典娜，找到你的梦境还真花了我们不少时间。,Athena. Finally. It took us quite a while to find your dream.
潘多拉？还有天后？你们两个人凑在一起可真让我意外……,Pandora? And Queen Hera? I am surprised the two of you are together...
以及……双子座？她怎么了？看起来黑暗之子像是丢失了神格。,And... Gemini? What's this? It looks like the Dark Twin has lost her divinity.
战争女神，你能看出我妹妹身上发生了什么吗？,"Goddess of War, can you see what's wrong with my sister?"
你想唤醒她吗？我建议你不要这么做，她身上似乎封印着不寻常的能量。,Do you wish to wake her up? I don't advise it. There seems to be an unsual energy sealed within her.
可是，这样下去的话，我担心她会再次做出伤害其他人的举动。,"But if it continues like this, I am worried that she will hurt others again."
如果你只是担心她会伤害到其他人的话……我倒是有个办法。,If you're just worried about her hurting other people... I have a solution for that.
什么办法？,What solution?
让她永远睡去。,Make her sleep forever.
！！！,!!!
如我所想，通过刚才的战斗，我更确定她是个巨大的威胁……,That battle confirmed my suspicions. She is a huge threat...
雅典娜，你的不近人情的性子该变变了，有趣的事情可不只有战争。,"Athena, this unkind temperament of yours needs to change."
非常遗憾，在我看来只有绝对的理智，才能维护这个世界的秩序。,I'm being honest and rational. Understand that I believe only logic and reason can maintain the order of this world.
这样会嫁不出去的哦。,Oh no-one is going to want to marry you at this rate.
双子座对话省略号,...
好吧，这次算你们赢了。,"Anyway, you guys won this time."
你不是一直想去和哈迪斯谈谈生意？要不要跟着我们一起去？,Don't you have some business to settle with Hades? Would you like to come with us?
……她上次把雅典的灵魂都划到了斯巴达名下，这笔账是该和她算算了。,"...She mistakenly registered a soul from Athens under the name of Sparta, our enemies!"
另外，我知道有个家伙能帮我们打开通往冥界的路——美杜莎。,"Hmm... Well, I know someone who can open the way to the underworld for us. Her name is Medusa."
但是我听说她是个不太好说话的人……,But I heard she doesn't like to talk to others.
没关系，作为她的“老朋友”，我会有办法让她开口的。,"It doesn't matter. As her old friend, I will make her talk."
美杜莎，赶紧出来见我，否则我就把你的神庙里摆满镜子！,"Medusa, come out! Or I will fill your temple with mirrors!"
雅典娜……怎么又是你，真是做梦都不让人自在。,Athena... It's you again. Your presence always ruins my dreams.
帮我做件事，我保证你就能继续安心做你的美梦。,"If you do something for me, I promise you can continue your sweet dreams undisturbed."
……她俩有仇吗？为什么一见面就要打架？,...Are these two enemies? Are we about to fight?
那可就说来话长了。,It's a long story. Get ready.
算我倒霉了，说吧，你要我帮你干嘛？,"Guess it's not my lucky day. So, what do you want from me?"
替我打开通往哈迪斯梦境的大门，我找那家伙……有点账要算。,Open the door to Hades' dream for me. I have a score to settle.
呵……我猜来猜去也就是这事，真是麻烦。,Heh... I thought so. What a bothersome request.
好了，冥界的大门打开了，你们快走吧，别再打搅我了。,"Alright, the gate to the underworld is open. Stop bothering me now."
谢谢你。,Thank you.
快走吧，趁我没改变主意之前，唉……,"Go, before I change my mind."
方塔苏斯，冥王之手，恶梦的使徒，我可真不想见到你……,"Ugh. Phantasos, Hand of Hades, Apostle of Nightmares. The last person I wanted to see."
作为厄运的象征，我也对你没什么好感。,"Well I don't like you much either, Miss Bad Luck."
不过相对于哈迪斯，你这家伙的糟糕性格我倒还能忍受。,"But unlike Hades, I can bear with your bad temper."
这么在背后议论她可不好，毕竟，整个冥界都是她的耳目。,"It's not good to talk about her behind her back. After all, the entire underworld is her eyes and ears."
另外……光明之子，你妹妹的身上似乎散发着冥界的味道呢。,"By the way... Light Twin, your sister seems to exude underworld energy."
看来事情变得糟糕了，不是吗？,Does it look like she's getting worse?
难说，虽然她身上确实有冥界的能量，但源头却不一定来自哈迪斯大人。,"It's hard to say. Although she has the underworld energy, the source isn't necessarily Lord Hades."
你能帮帮我们吗？,Can you help us?
我确实对她身上的能量感兴趣……不如把她留在这里，让我好好研究研究如何？,I'm really interested in the energy in her... How about leaving her here and letting me study it?
如果我能研究出超越哈迪斯大人力量的方式，也是个不错的交易呢。,I'm dying to find a way to surpasss Lady Hades in power.
时间都过去这么久了，你的野心还是那么大。来吧，有本事就来抢！,"Hah! Even after so much time, your ambitions are still as big as ever. Come and take her, if you can!"
把眼睛睁大点，见识见识我的恶梦吧！,Open your eyes wide - see my nightmare!
非常遗憾，你的恶梦影响不到我们。,Such a pity... Your nightmares don't affect us.
怎么可能……,How can this be...?
亲爱的，这可是在我的梦境中，你的力量再强也不过如此。,"Darling, this is my Dreamland. Your powers are limited here."
……这次就先放过你们，下次再见面的时候，我可不会留手了！,...I'll let you go this time. But I won't hold back when we meet next time!
总算送走了个危险的家伙，前方还不知道会有什么样的麻烦在等着我们。,Phew! We made it out of there safely. She's a dangerous foe. And who knows what other dangers lie ahead.
希望我妹妹能平安度过这次危机。,I hope my sister can pull through this safely.
梦境越来越模糊了，潘多拉，你确定一切还在你的掌控之中？,"The dream is getting more and more blurry. Pandora, are you sure everything is still under your control?"
这有些奇怪……我没有感觉到哈迪斯的力量。,This is a bit strange... And I don't sense Hades' power.
真是稀客，不过我的结界可不是想来就来，想走就走的呢。,How rare! A visitor.
伊邪那美？大和神明在希腊冥王的梦境里干什么？,Izanami? What is a Yamato goddess doing in the dream of the Greek goddess Hades?
作为黄泉的掌控者，只要有死亡的地方，我便无处不在。,"As master of the underworld, wherever death is, I am too."
既然有幸光临我的梦境，不如留下来陪我聊聊天如何……,"Since you are lucky enough to visit my Dreamland, how about staying for a chat..."
抱歉，我们赶时间。,"Sorry, we are in a rush."
哎呀，真是一群不解风情的家伙呢。,"So rude... Next time, politely accept my invitation to chat and we won't have to fight."
容我先告辞了，一会还有更重要的客人要见呐……呵呵。,Let's take our leave first. We have someone more important to meet.
继续前进吧，前面好像就是哈迪斯的神殿了。,"Yes, let's keep going. It seems that the temple of Hades is up ahead."
潘多拉？你终于肯回来见我了。,Pandora? You finally came back to see me.
别误会，我可不是来见你的，我是来帮我的委托人找你问话的。,"No, this isn't about coming to see you. I'm here to help Gemini as part of an agreement."
有什么不一样吗？不管如何，你终究还是得求我帮忙。,"Either way, you'll still have to ask me for help."
闲话少说，双子座身上的冥界能量是怎么回事？我打赌这事情又是你搞的鬼。,Enough chitchat. What is with the underworld energy radiating from Gemini? I bet that you're behind it... again.
什么叫又？我难道干过那么多坏事吗？,What do you mean again? What have I ever done to you? ... I've never... Wait... What is...?
不过挺有趣的，这个小家伙的身体里正在孕育新的力量。,... How interesting. There is a new power growing inside this little one's body.
而当她苏醒时，将会变成除了我，海拉，伊邪那美，阿努比斯之外的一位新冥界管理者。,"And once her metamorphosis is complete, she will become a new ruler of the underworld alongside me, Izanami and Anubis."
你……你在说什么？这不可能……,What are you talking about? She'll never...
不相信吗？我来引导黑暗之子身体里真正的潜能，让你开开眼界吧！,You don't believe me? Let me use the true potential of the power within the body of the Dark Twin and show you.
这力量……无比强大，但也让人畏惧，我还是头一次有这种感觉……,"This power... it's amazing, but it's also terrifying. ... This is the first time I have felt like this..."
当黑暗之子体内的新力量苏醒后，你你将获得无穷的力量。,"When this new power in the Dark Twinness awakens, you will gain infinite power."
拥有强大的力量，保护另一个自己不是你追求的吗？ 现在做出选择吧。,Do you not wish to have great power to protect each other?
我……只想回到原本的生活，和妹妹一起的平静生活！,I... just want things to go back to the way they were. I want a peaceful life with my sister!
呵呵，我尊重你的选择，但在我唤醒黑暗之子后，你是不是会后悔，就是另一回事了。,"I respect your choice, but you'll regret it once I interrupt this process to wake her up..."
黑暗之子，黄道之上的双子之星，听从我的呼唤，醒来吧……,"Dark Twin, Twin Stars of the Zodiac. Heed my call, awaken from your slumber..."
妹妹？你……醒过来了？,Sister? Are you... awake?
姐姐，你为什么要打乱我的计划？我所做的一切，都是为了创造一个让你获得幸福的世界。,Sister! Why are you messing with my plans?! Everything I'm doing is to create a world where you can be happy!
你难道忘了我们曾经的弱小？忘了那些利用我们的所谓的“女神”？,"Have you forgotten how weak you are? Unlike me, you were born a mortal. I can change all of that!"
你错了，我已经很幸福了，因为你在我身边。,None of that matters! I'm happy as long as you are by my side.
如果有一天你的灵魂消失了，那么即便是让我拥有整个世界，又有什么用呢？,"If you destroy your soul... then what's the point?? Even if I had the whole world, I'd have nothing without you!"
你总是这么软弱……好吧，那就让我在战斗中让你明白力量的意义！,You have always been so weak. I will have to show you the meaning of power!
为什么你不能接受我的做法？,Why can you just accept my plans?
假如我的强大，要用我妹妹的生命来交换，那我宁愿不要！,"If I have to trade my sister's life for that, then I don't want it at all!"
我明白了……即时拥有哈迪斯的力量，还是无法战胜你，真正强大的还是你的信念……,"I... understand. It seems that even if I have the power of Hades, I still cannot defeat you. What is truly powerful is your love for me."
哎呀呀……真是令人感动的场景，然而我们没时间继续欣赏了。,"Oops I hate to interrupt such a touching scene, but..."
既然你不愿意牺牲妹妹，那么我只好收回黑暗之子身体里的能量了。,"Since you are unwilling to sacrifice your sister, I have no choice but to take back the energy in her body."
经过梦境试炼后，你们的默契大概也能赋予彼此强大的战斗力吧，呵呵……,"However... After the trials you've faced in the Dreamland, perhaps this newfound understanding can make you both much stronger."
虽然我很不想这么说，但我依旧需要谢谢你，哈迪斯。,"As much as I hate to say it, I owe you my thanks, Hades."
好了亲爱的，你想要的都得到了，是时候谈谈我的报酬了，哼哼……,"Alright darling, you got what you wanted. It's time to talk about what you owe me."
你说得对，力量是保护她的唯一方式……,You're right. Power is the only way to protect her...
明智的选择，冥界期待着新的管理者，新世界的降临指日可待……,A wise choice. The underworld is looking forward to a new ruler. The advent of a new world is just around the corner...

又称“死海文书”，是记载圣经中失落传说的神话古卷。在发明纸张之前，人们喜欢在鞣制后的羊皮上书写文字，那些上古的寓言，禁忌的咒语，统统以这种方式保存了下来。,"Also known as the Dead Sea Scrolls, these are long-lost copies of mostly Hebrew text. They were preserved on parchment made from sheepskin since the people in that region had not yet discovered paper."
供奉于大多数日本稻荷神社中的面具，一般是通灵仪式上的宝物，神主们戴上它，与鬼神进行沟通。,These masks are enshrined in most Inari shrines in Japan. They are typically considered ritual treasures worn by gods for communication with ghosts and other deities.
普罗米修斯带给人类的最早的火种，智慧与文明的象征。即使没有任何燃料，它也永恒不灭。,"Prometheus gifted humanity with the earliest kindling, and the resulting fire symbolized civilization and wisdom. The flame burns eternally, even without fuel."
供奉于埃及神庙的贡品，是古代埃及众神少有的能够精准计时的工具，当一测被沙子填满，而另一侧空空如也时，则意味着需要进行昼夜更替了。,"In ancient Egypt, this object was prized for their ability to accurately measure time. During temple worship, they helped priests mark the day's passing."

潘多拉，你在哪？我知道这梦境是你造出来的，别躲了！,"Pandora,stop hiding! I know this is your Dreamland."
这不是阿斯加德的芙蕾雅女神嘛，您大驾光临还真让我意外……,"My, my, Freyja of Asgard? What a surprise."
别贫嘴了，我需要你帮我个忙。,I need a favor.
开门见山？我喜欢。说说看吧，你遇到什么麻烦了？,"Straight to business? I like that. So, what do you need?"
奥丁失踪了，至今下落不明，我敢打赌她一定是又溜到某个角落逍遥快活去了。,Odin is missing again. I'm sure she's off somewhere having a good time again...
阿斯加德不能一直处在没有统治者的境况下，我希望你帮我把她找出来。,But Asgard cannot remain without a ruler for long. So I need you to help me find her.
明白，但按照梦境的规矩，为了不让你迷失在此，必须要测试测试你的实力。,"Sure. But, as per my rules, you must first pass my test of strength."
你的规矩可真多……我准备好了，来吧。,"So many rules... Fine, let's do it."
怎么样，我通过了吗？,"So, did I pass?"
你的实力毋庸置疑。,There is no doubt about your strength.
好了，咱们来商量商量对策吧。,Good. Then let's come up with a plan for retrieving Odin.
据我所知，奥丁是北欧众神中最强大的吧？想把她弄回来，光我们两个的力量恐怕不行。,"Odin is the most powerful of the Norse Gods, right? If we want to make her return, we will need more than just the two of us."
没错，但你不用担心，只管告诉我奥丁的去向吧，帮手的事我来搞定。,You just worry about finding Odin for me. I will take care of finding strong allies.
海姆达尔，阿斯加德的守护者，我有要事找你。,"Heimdall, Guardian of Asgard and the Bifrost, I have business with you."
芙蕾雅，什么风把你给吹来了。,"Freyja, what brings you to me?"
奥丁去什么地方了，你号称无所不晓，应该不会不知道她的去向吧？,"Where did Odin go? You know all who pass through the Bifrost, so you surely know her whereabouts, right?"
抱歉，这件事我曾向奥丁保证，绝不泄露她的去向。,"I'm sorry, I promised Odin that I would not reveal her whereabouts."
我要怎么样才能让你明白，奥丁的离开，让阿斯加德现在处于极大的危险之中。,You must understand that Odin's absence puts Asgard in great danger.
我明白您的意思，但这关乎我的誓言。,I cannot break my oath.
誓言比阿斯加德的安危还重要吗？,Is your honor more important than the safety of Asgard?
或许我有个办法可以帮助你，不过你得先和我打一架。,...Perhaps there is a way I can help. But you will need to defeat me in battle.
好，只要能把奥丁找回来，我无所谓用什么方法。,I will use any method necessary to ensure Odin's return to Asgard.
打得不错，看来在梦境中，你的力量更强。,You fought well. It seems your strength is greater in the Dreamland.
就……这么简单？你你并没有全力应战吧？,"That was too easy. You didn't fight with your full strength, did you?"
我确实不能违背誓言告诉你奥丁的行踪，但作为你的俘虏，你有权要求我避开错误的路线。,"...I am now your prisoner, and as such, you can order me to advise you when you are going in the wrong direction."
你是说，只要不直接指出具体的路就行了？我就知道靠得住你，我们走吧。,"I see. So as long as you don't directly lead me to the correct path, you will not be breaking your oath? Let's go!"
遵命，女士。,"As you command, my lady."
芙蕾雅，你们去哪？,"Freyja, where are you going?"
索尔？你该不会也是奥丁派来拦路的吧？,Thor? Did Odin send you to block my way as well?
奥丁？我也在找她，她同意了我和女武神们的决斗赛，可我等了半天都没见着她人。,"Odin? I am also looking for her. She agreed to a duel with me and Valkyrie, but she never showed up."
呵……她一向如此，我们去找她回来吧。,That is so like her. Join me - I will find her and make her return to Asgard.
我是没问题，不过……在此之前，我想好好热个身——毕竟我可不希望在决斗赛上输掉！,"I will join you, but... First, I want a warm up battle. After all, I don't want to lose my duel later."
我就说你怎么会这么好说话，到头来还是要动手打架……行吧，我接受。,"I was just thinking it's easy to talk to you, but I guess we still have to fight. Alright, I accept your challenge."
那是我的荣幸，芙蕾雅女神。,"It is an honor, Lady Freyja."
还打吗，索尔？你已经输了。,"Do you still want to continue, Thor? You have already lost."
哼……这次算你赢了，不过热身准备也结束了，我们去找奥丁吧！,"Hmph! I concede... this time. I've warmed up now, so let's go find Odin!"
前面就是女武神的梦境了，寻找奥丁的事情，我们可以让她一起来帮忙。,This is Valkryie's dream. We can ask her to help search for Odin.
你最好小心些，我听说她最近在和其他人的比试中输了，现在正在气头上呢。,"Be careful. I heard she recently lost a duel, so she's in a bad mood."
你说谁输了？索尔。,Who did you say lost!?
天哪……你是幽灵吗？走路一点声音都没有……,Gods! Are you a ghost? Make some sound when you walk!
你觉得我输了对吗？那就和我较量较量如何！,You think I'd lose? Fight me and see.
你们北欧众神都是这么……随性的吗？,Are all Norse gods so... reckless and carefree?
……别误会，只有她们这群拳头说话的家伙才这样。,...Don't get the wrong idea about us. It's just hotheads like them that like to talk with their fists.
怎么样？,So?
平手而已，你怎么好意思觉得是你赢了？,It was a tie! Don't you dare think you won.
行了，你们想再较量的话，不如尽快把奥丁找回来，让决斗大赛尽快开始。,"Alright, alright. If you two want to fight again, let's get Odin back quickly so you can have your duel."
……奥丁又出走了？,...Odin is missing again?
不然你觉得为什么我们会在这儿？,Why would we be here otherwise?
前面的好像是希芙，她在这儿干嘛？,That looks like Sif up ahead. What is she doing here?
看样子她是在找什么东西。,She seems to be searching for something.
我的头发……我的黄金头发，不见了？,My hair... my golden hair. It's gone!
你在念叨什么呢？,What are you talking about?
是你偷走了我的金发吗？,Did you steal my golden hair?
你在瞎说什么？你的头发不是在脑袋上吗？,Isn't your hair on your head?
把我的头发还给我！,Give me back my hair!
……你这家伙，脑袋还挺硬，把你打趴下还真耗了我不少力气！,You're as tough as ever. That was a difficut fight.
好痛，发生了什么事？,Ow... Why does my body hurt?
啊？不是你怒气冲冲地朝我们冲过来了吗？,Huh? Did you forget you just attacked us?
我刚才还在梦境里遇到洛基，几秒后我就失去意识了，一定是她捣的鬼……,"...A few moments ago I met Loki, but I can't remember what happened next. She must have done something to me."
又是这家伙！如果让我抓到她，一定要把她头上那对角锯下来！,"Her again! Next time I see her, I'm going to grab her by the horns and saw them off!"
不用下次了，很快她就会主动现身了，这次奥丁出走，肯定少不了她在旁边煽风点火。,I don't think you will have to wait long. Odin leaving is the perfect opportunity for her to stir up trouble. She wouldn't be able to resist.
洛基，快出来！我知道你躲在这里！,"Loki, I know you're there! Come out!"
我还准备给你们来个惊喜，没想到你们这么快就能发现我。,I was going to surprise you guys. I didn't expect you to find me first.
你向来学不乖，老实交代，奥丁在哪儿？,"You're always up to no good. Be honest, where is Odin?"
哎呀……原来奥丁不见了，这可真让人遗憾……不过我可不清楚她的下落。,Oh no... Odin is missing... Such a pity... But I have no idea where she is.
你满脸不怀好意地说出这种话，实在让人信不过，或许只有拳头能让你开口了！,Your words don't match your expression. I guess we will have to beat the truth out of you!
哼，看来几位在梦境中的力量，比我想象中大呢……,Hmph. It seems that your power is greater than I thought in this Dreamland.
坦白的时间到了，亲爱的。,"It's time for you to confess, sweetie."
算了算了，看在旧日的交情上，我就帮你们一回好了。,"Forget about that. Since we're old friends, I will help out just this once."
奥丁现在在哪儿我不清楚，但她之前和北欧那几头龙混在一块。,"I don't know where Odin is now, but she was with the Nordic dragons earlier."
真是糟糕……我有不好的预感。,The dragons? I have a bad feeling about this.
女神们，挑战的时刻到了，我将逐个击败你们，证明我有继承奥丁神权的资格！,Goddesses! I challenge you! I will defeat you one by one to prove that I am qualified to inherit Odin's divine right.
……,...
好吧，如果不是在梦里，我保证你现在已经被送上断头台了。,"How impudent! If we weren't in a dream right now, your heads would roll for this."
遗憾的是，奥丁确实允诺强者可以继承阿斯加德的最高神权。,Unfortunately not. Since Odin has promised that the strongest will inherit her position as Supreme Ruler of Asgard.
说得好！所以你们俩打算一起上？还是……,"Is that so? Well then, do you two plan to come at us together? Or...?"
没必要，我一个人对付你们已经足够了！放马过来吧！我并不觉得人多就能赢！,Hah! I alone am enough to deal with you all. Bring it on!
……在我的梦境中居然还能发挥出这么强大的力量，这不可能！,Impossible! How could you have such strength in my dream?
输了就退下吧，姐妹，让我来告诉她们实力的差距……,"If you've lost, sister, step aside. Let me show them the difference in strength."
希望这里的温度会让你们产生回家了的感觉。,Does the cold temperature here remind you of home?
既然你明白我们不惧寒冷，还想用冰雪来击败我们吗？,"Since you already know that we aren't afraid of the cold, do you still think you can beat us with a little snow?"
我的力量可不只是普通的风雪……,My power is no ordinary snowstorm...
我早就说过了，阿斯加德众神千年来都与北欧的冰雪为伴，不会惧怕任何寒冷。,I told you so. We Asgardian Gods have lived in the Nordic ice for thousands of years.
我承认你们的实力，但遗憾的是，我不觉得奥丁会跟你们回阿斯加德……,"I acknowledge your strength. But unfortunately, I don't think Odin will go back to Asgard with you..."
理由呢？,Why not?
因为我已经厌倦当个 统治者了，亲爱的。,"Because I am tired of ruling, my dear."
奥丁，原来你还真躲在潘多拉的梦境里，你知道阿斯加德都遭遇了些什么吗？,Odin! So you really were hiding in Pandora's Dreamland. Do you have any idea what is happening to Asgard?
不知道，但既然众神都完好无损，我相信你已经处理妥当了一切。,"Nope, no idea. But since you are all in one piece, I believe you have everything under control."
你可真能推脱，现在众神无首，万一希腊的那群好战的家伙打过来……,"You really are shirking your duties... Asgard is weakened without a leader, what if those warmongerers from Greece come looking for a fight?"
啊……我只是想清闲一段日子而已，何况我已经宣布选出神权继承者的方法了，不是吗？,"Ah I just want to relax. Besides, I have already announced how my successor will be chosen, haven't I?"
抱歉，众神可没同意你这个草率到家的决定。,"Sorry, but we don't agree with your rash decision."
阿斯加德不可以没有你的智慧，如果你一定要留在梦境里的话……,Asgard cannot be without your wisdom. So if you insist on staying in the Dreamland...
我们就只能用一些不太温柔的手段把你请回去了。,We will have to do this the hard way.
呵呵……想来硬的也不是不行，在希腊那群家伙的习惯里，还保留着弑神登位的传统呢。,Hehe... I like it hard.
你看上去不像是在开玩笑，那么我们只好让你吃点苦头了，大人。,"...You're serious about leaving. Then we will give you a hard time, my lady."
不错，芙蕾雅，你的力量在梦境里成长的速度比我想象中快得多。,"Not bad, Freyja. Your strength has grown much faster in the Dreamland than I could have imagined."
你能让我看到如此强大的决心，或许阿斯加德在你手上会有更光明的未来。,You have displayed such strong determination. Perhaps Asgard will have a brighter future in your hands.
你在说什么蠢话。,Stop saying such ridiculous things.
自古以来，北欧众神一直尊崇武力与荣耀，如今你的力量已经超过了我。,"Since ancient times, the Norse gods have always respected power and glory. And your strength has now surpassed mine."
或许轮到你晋升成为新的阿斯加德守护者了。,Maybe it is time for you to become the new leader of Asgard.
然而我并非最好的人选……,I am not the best candidate though...
阿斯加德不需要一个王，也从来不是某个人说了算，而是需要集体的智慧。,Asgard does not need a single ruler to make decisions for all. But rather someone to lead the collective voices and wisdom of the gods.
我很早就想做出改变了，不能由一个人的意志来决定每个人的命运。,I have long wanted to change the ruling system. The fate of all cannot be determined by one person's will.
虽然我足够强大，但我的固执和偏见并非是好事，你却能给众神带来新的希望。,"Although I am strong, my stubborness and prejudice is not good for Asgard. But you can bring new hope to the gods."
呵呵，如果你执意这么认为，那么至少在你改变想法前，我会继续执政阿斯加德。,"If you really think I would be suitable to lead Asgard, then I will undergo the Trial of the Guardian."
很好，我知道你不会让我失望。,I am certain you won't let me down.
当试炼开始时，我会模拟诸神黄昏的幻象，你将面对我们的终末。,"When the trial begins, you will see a vision of Ragnarok and will have to face the end of Asgard."
如果你们能通过我最大的敌人，洛基的考验，那么我就承认你有资格领导众神。,"If you can defeat my worst enemy, Loki, then there will be no doubt that you are worthy to lead the Norse Gods."
我明白了。,I understand. I am ready.
一定要小心！虽然是幻象，但她承载了我的神力，其危险程度不亚于真实的末日！,"Be careful. Although it is an illusion, she carries my divine power and is as dangerous as if this were the real Ragnarok."
看来命运如此，我们度过了诸神黄昏……,"As fate would have it, we made it through Ragnarok."
你做的很好，阿斯加德将迎来新的纪元，所有的人都将成为它的主人。,"Well done. Asgard will usher in a new era, and all will have a say in its future."
我会记住这份职责的，连同这份强大的力量。,"I will accept this duty, along with this new power."
不，传统不应就此改变。,"No, age-old traditions should not be changed."
如果你真的这么认为，那么我接受守护者试炼。,"Well if you insist, then I will continue to rule Asgard. At least, until you change your mind..."

巴里，你发现了吗？这里出现了一个奇怪的入口，我们去看看怎么样？,"Bari, do you see that? There’s a weird portal over there. Should we check it out?"
小心一点，这个好像是一个时间裂缝，我感觉不太对劲，好像有什么不好的事情要发生了。,Be careful. It looks like another time rift. I have a bad feeling about this. Something terrible might happen.
放心，有我在这什么都不用怕，但是在这个裂缝外面好像看不出什么问题，要不我们进去看看吧？,Don’t worry. I’m here with you. Nothing can hurt us. But I don’t see anything wrong outside the rift. Maybe we should go in and see for ourselves?
哎，等等我，你怎么还是这么冒冒失失的！,"Hey, slow down! Why are you always so impulsive?"
巴里，火，到处都是火，整个世界都被燃烧起来了。,"Bari, fire! There’s fire everywhere! The world is on fire!"
小心，穿过裂缝的时候我感觉到了时间女神的力量在被削弱了。,Watch out! I felt some mysterious source weaken the goddess of time's power when we crossed the rift.
这里就是我们的世界，而且这个地方也很熟悉……好像是我们第一次相遇的地方？,"This is our world. And that place… It’s where we first met, right?"
我们小心一点，查探一下到底发生了什么。,Let’s be cautious and figure out what’s going on.
啊，巴里，我记得它，第一次战斗的时候打败的就是它。,"Oh no, Bari! I recognize that thing! We beat it in our first fight!"
看，还有那边，那些曾经战斗过的怪物又再次出现了。,And look over there! Those old enemies are back!
看来时间女神的力量出现了错乱，导致那些被消灭的怪物再次出现，并且变得更加危险了。,Something’s wrong with the order of time. It brought back those monsters we killed and made them stronger.
完全不在怕的，能消灭它第一次，就能消灭它一万次。,"But I’m not scared. If we can beat them once, we can beat them again and again."
好，既然如此那就拿起武器继续战斗吧！,Alright then. Let’s grab our weapons and keep fighting!

哟，这是谁呀，难道是陷入迷茫的女神，正在寻找指路明灯？,"Yo, who's this here? Another lost and confused goddess looking for a guiding light?"
希腊的灾厄之女潘多拉？什么风把你吹到这来的？,"Pandora, the Greek Daughter of Misfortune? What wind brought you here?"
有趣，与其说是我来到你身边，不如说是你误入了我的梦境。,"Rather than me coming to you, it is you who have strayed into my Dreamland."
让我来看看你的真名吧……阿斯加德的弗丽嘉，北欧的鲜花与爱之女神么？,"Let me see which one we have today... Frigga of Asgard, Nordic Goddess of Flowers and Love?"
听说你可不是一个好应付的家伙呢，曾经有多少人因你而陶醉，又有多少人因你而心碎呢？,I heard you are a troublesome one to deal with. How many people have been intoxicated by you? How many people have suffered heartbreak because of you?
那可都是些陈年往事了，现在的我可和过去不一样。,That is all in the past. I am not the same now as I used to be.
哦……现在得称呼你“天后”大人了。不过你神情踌躇，是遇到什么麻烦了吗？,"Oh yeah... Now I should be calling you Queen of Asgard... But why do you look so troubled, Your Majesty?"
我虽贵为北欧天后，可众神真的认同我的身份吗？我以前在北欧的名声可不怎么样……,"I may be Queen of Asgard in name, but do the other gods even recognize my authority? My reputation in the North used to be quite bad..."
我想改善自己和阿斯加德女神们的关系，但不知道该如何去做。,"I want to improve my relationship with the Asgardian goddesses, but I don't know how."
改善自己的名声吗？那你至少算找对人了……,"Improve your reputation? Well it's your lucky day! I've become rather good at granting wishes, heh."
我建议你去找芙蕾雅，如果能与她和解，那么众神大概会相信你的决心。,"I suggest you go to Freyja. If you can reconcile with her, then the others will probably trust your determination and resolve."
真的吗？但我听很多人说过，请潘多拉帮忙的代价可不小……,Really? But I've heard a lot of people say that your help comes at a price...
呵呵……代价等事成之后再谈也不迟，让我先看看你的能力。,Hehe... We can talk about the price later. Let me see your ability first.
毕竟只有具备强大意志力和战斗力的人，才不至于在我的梦境中迷失……,"After all, only those with a strong will and combat ability can traverse my Dreamland without fear of getting lost..."
胜负已分，至少在战斗这方面我还是很有信心的。,"The outcome is clear. I am confident in my combat abilities, aren't you?"
我大概知道你为什么会和其他的北欧女神闹出矛盾了……你还真是个危险的家伙。,...I am starting to understand why you're in conflict with the other Norse goddesses... You really are quite dangerous.
我大概知道你的力量了，只不过如你所说，芙蕾雅肯定不会轻易被你说服。,"Well, I have a good estimate of your strength now. But Freyja will not be so easily persuaded."
我们得需要几个同伴……你有什么推荐人选吗？,You will need some more companions to back you up. Is there anyone you suggest?
如果要我选的话，我看洛基非常适合，她平时总能想出奇怪的点子，我带你去找她。,"Well since you asked, I think Loki would be a good choice. She always comes up with the most interesting and unique ideas."
天哪……你可真会挑人……,Oh my gods... You really know how to pick them...
洛基，你在吗？,"Loki, are you there?"
我知道你在这里！十秒内你要是再不出来，我就把你的梦敲成碎片！,"I know you are here! If you don't come out within 10 seconds, I will smash this place to pieces!"
我相信她一定是藏起来了，你仔细想想，她一般会藏在什么地方？,I believe she is hiding. Where does she usually like to hide?
她会变成一些奇怪的东西……啊！我想起来了，她壁炉里的火还燃着呢！,She likes to shapeshift into random things... Ah! The fire was still burning in her hearth!
痛痛痛！快放手！,Ouch! Let go!
你果然变成了炉火。,"Sure enough, you changed into fire."
你找到我也没有用！你说什么我都不听！你说什么我也不答应！,It's pointless to find me! I won't listen to you! I won't do what you want!
……,...
她要逃跑了，快追上去！,She is running away! Quickly! Catch her!
弗丽嘉大人，求您放过我吧，我保证再也不出现在您面前了！,"Lady Frigga, please let me go! I promise I will never appear in front of you again!"
……你以前到底对诡诈之神做过什么可怕的事，她见你像老鼠见了猫一样……,...What terrible things have you done to the Goddess of Deception? She's shaking like a mouse in front of a cat.
够了够了，你们究竟想要我干嘛？只要肯放我走，我什么都答应你们！,Enough please. What do you want from me? Let me go and I will do anything!
我想去和芙蕾雅和解。,I want to reconcile with Freyja.
我觉得你不会成功的，毕竟谁都知道你的性格实在是……,"Can't you ask me to do something easier? I don't think it's possible for you to reconcile. After all, everyone knows what your personality is like..."
所以我们才找到了你啊，弗丽嘉大人可是对你抱有期待呢。,That's why we came to find you. Lady Frigga has high expectations for you.
好吧，我试试看，但对我来说，这真不是什么值得高兴的事情……,"Ugh, I'll give it a try. But I'm not happy about it..."
前面就是索尔的宫殿了，想通往梦境中的阿斯加德，必须经过这里。,"This is the door to Thor's palace. If you want to reach Asgard in this Dreamland, you must pass through here."
大门关得可真够紧……不过洛基，你会有办法的，对吧？,"The door is locked... Loki, you will have a way, won't you?"
索尔你这个酒鬼、蠢货、锤子脑袋！快出来！否则你的白日梦就到此为止了！,Thor! You drunkard! Fool! Hammer-head! Come out quickly! Otherwise I will steal Mjölnir!
洛基，又是你这个麻烦家伙……上次挨揍的苦头你还没吃够么？,Loki! You troublesome pest... Haven't you had enough of the pain of being beaten up from last time?
等等……！弗丽嘉？你在这里做什么？为什么你会和洛基在一起？,Wait a second... Frigga? What are you doing here? Why are you with Loki?
别在意，亲爱的，我只是想与芙蕾雅和解，让洛基来找你帮忙而已。,"Don't worry about that, my angel. I want to reconcile with Freyja. Loki's just here to help."
所以她就是这么请我帮忙的？在我的门前破口大骂？,So her help is calling me names in front of my own palace?
这个……只有这种办法，才能让你从酩酊大醉中清醒过来。,Well... You see... That's because it's the only way to wake you from your drunken nap.
好吧，既然是弗丽嘉出面，我当然没理由不答应，不过我有个条件……,"Since it's you asking, Frigga, I have no reason to decline. But..."
是和我比试比试吗？没问题……,"Heh. You want a fight, right? Go ahead."
到此为止吧，我认输，说实话，你的锤子比以前温柔多了。,"Okay okay. Let's call it here. I admit defeat. I have to say though, your fighting style is... much gentler than before."
毕竟我也是天后了，不能再那么粗暴下去了呢。,"I am a queen now, after all. I can't be as rough as I used to be."
事已至此，我同意和你们一起去芙蕾雅大人的梦境，但路上可能会遇到一些麻烦。,"Anyway, I agreed to accompany you to Lady Freyja's dream, but we may run into some trouble on the way."
麻烦？,Trouble?
因为要经过女武神们的梦境，她们可不像我这么好说话……,"Yes, because we will have to pass through Valkyrie's dream. She isn't as easy-going as I am."
弗丽嘉，我可没邀请你来我的军营，如果你再往前一步，我就要发起冲锋了。,"Frigga, I did not invite you into the barracks of the Valkyries. If you take one more step, I will make you regret it."
首席女武神，以弗丽嘉现在的身份而言，你至少要保持礼仪。,"Leader of the Valkyries, you should remember Frigga's status. She is Queen. Show some respect."
她以前目中无人的时候，可没有提到过什么礼仪。,And where was the respect when she treated us like shit?
我为过去的所作所为向你道歉，也正因为如此，我需要去与芙蕾雅和解。,I apologize for my past actions. That is exactly why I want to see Freyja.
好吧，如果你们能在战斗中胜过我，我就放你们过去。,"Let's settle this with a fight. If you win, I will let you pass. If I win, you shall not pass!"
我接受这个挑战，除此之外，我希望你能与我一同前去和芙蕾雅谈谈。,"I accept your challenge! But if I win, you will also come with me."
这些话等打完再说吧！,You will have to beat me first!
呼……索尔，我开始明白你为什么会帮她了。,"Phew... Thor, I'm beginning to understand why you're helping her."
很简单，她是除奥丁大人外北欧最重要的存在。,"To put it simply, she is the most important existence to the Norse Gods, other than Lady Odin."
她在成为天后之前，并不是一个光明正大、值得尊敬的人。,"Before she was queen, she wasn't exactly a fair and honorable person..."
但这场战斗中她的技巧，已经让我见识到了她的荣耀感。,"But during this battle, I glimpsed her sense of honor."
我们是战士，战士的天职就是服从领主的命令，即便她要求我牺牲，那我也无可推辞。,"We are warriors. We are duty-bound to obey our liege's orders. Even if she commanded my sacrifice, I would not complain."
也许你说的对……,Perhaps you're right... Alright.
如今的我一定不会辜负你的信任，瓦尔基里。,"I will not betray your trust in me, Valkyrie."
弗丽嘉大人？,Frigga?
希芙？,Sif?
没想到我躲到梦境里你还能找得到，唉……所以你这次又要去折腾哪个倒霉家伙？,I didn't think you'd be able to find me even in a dream. So who's the unlucky one you're going to mess with this time?
芙蕾雅，我需要与她和解，然后修复自己与阿斯加德众神的关系。,I need to see Freyja. I want to reconcile with her and patch up my relationship with the other Asgardian gods.
这代价恐怕不小，毕竟当年你和她可是为了争夺天后的地位而对立的……,"That's not going to be easy. After all, you were rivals in the fight for the throne..."
所以我才来找你帮忙，无论其他人立场如何，作为大地女神，你始终会会支持我。,"That's why I came to you for help. Regardless of other people's opinion, I know you will have my back."
除非你的力量强到能够击败最强守护者海姆达尔，否则你依旧过不了彩虹桥。,"Unless you are strong enough to defeat Heimdall, the Guardian of the Bifrost, you will not be able to cross that rainbow bridge into Asgard."
要来试试吗？,Wanna see for yourself if I am?
那当然，我可不希望白跑一趟。,Of course. I wouldn't want to go all the way there for nothing.
这可真不像你以前的力量，弗丽嘉。,"This is not like your old powers, Frigga."
有你的帮忙后，我相信是能越过海姆达尔这道难关的。,"With your help, I believe that we can handle Heimdall."
唉……希望那个死脑筋能理解你的用意。,Ugh I do hope that mudsclehead understands your intentions.
前方是芙蕾雅大人的宫殿，我不能让您随意通过，抱歉……即便您是天后。,"Stop. Beyond this point is Lady Freyja's palace. I can let you go no further, not even if you are the Queen."
我是过去向她问好的，并且向她传递我的和解邀请。,I wish to give her my greetings and an invitation to reconcile.
是这样吗？我听说你在举办酒宴，试图和曾经交恶的女神改善关系。,"Is that so? I heard that you are holding a banquet, with the intention of repairing bad relationships"
的确是这样。,You heard correctly.
好吧，但出于对芙蕾雅大人的职责，我必须要保卫她的安全。,I see. But I must still abide by my duty to keep Lady Freyja safe.
假如你们能胜我半筹，我就当你们击败了我，放你们通过。,"If you can defeat me at half my power, I will consider it your victory and let you pass."
谢谢你的通情达理，海姆达尔。,"Thank you for understanding, Heimdall."
你们赢了，我不会继续阻拦你们，但请你们一定要谨慎行事。,"You have won. I will not hinder your passage any further, but please be careful."
请放心，不管如何我不是来惹麻烦，而是来解决问题的。,"Rest assured, my intention is not to cause issues. But to resolve them."
恕我直言……为什么洛基这个家伙会在这个队伍里呢？,With all due respect... what is Loki doing here?
这个嘛……她是我重要的伙伴——至少这次是。,Well... she is a valuable asset to me. This time.
嗯，你对我有什么意见吗？亲爱的？,"Got something to say about me, sweetheart? Heh."
好久没有看到如此强大的组合了，你们这阵势……是要去打架？,"Well, well. What a powerful group of people. Such a team - are you guys looking for a fight?"
……我们只是去拜访芙蕾雅而已。,...We're just visiting Freyja.
哼哼……你们有给我带礼物来吗？即使这里是梦境，但也属于龙神的地盘。,"Hmph... Did you bring me a gift? Even though this is the Dreamland, this territory still belongs to us Dragons."
要不然……我把洛基送您？实话说，她的装饰性还挺强的。,"Um... I can give you Loki? Look at her, she'd make a very pretty decoration."
我对这个家伙没兴趣，不管如何，想通过龙族的领地，礼物是必要的。,"Not interested. If you want to pass through my territory, I expect a proper gift."
火龙之主，你这话的意思……是想挑战阿斯加德最高的权威之一吗？,"Lady Ember, do you mean... you want to challenge Asgard's Queen?"
索尔，我可是看着你长大的，也许你不知道，龙族的规矩可是奥丁也必须遵守的。,"Little Thor, I watched you grow up. You may not know this, but even Odin must abide by the rules of the Dragon Clan."
可我不是奥丁，亲爱的。,"But I'm not Odin, honey."
喔……这样吗？好，就让我看看这几千年来，你打架的本事成长了多少！,"Clearly. Fine, let me see if your fighting skills have improved in the past thousand years! Or if I need to get out the diapers for you. Haha!"
打得不错，你们既然在战斗中能胜过我，礼物的事情就免了吧，哈哈。,What a good fight! I will consider that your gift.
别这么说，我依旧会为你打造两座雕像，一座立在阿斯加德的花园中，一座送给你。,"Don't be silly. I will have two statues built in your honor. One to stand in the Asgardens, and one for your territory."
天后，你客气了，祝你和芙蕾雅聊得愉快。,"You don't have to do so much for me, my Queen. I wish you luck in your chat with Freyja."
弗丽嘉，你来了。,"Frigga, you've arrived."
奥丁？你怎么在这里？,Odin? Why are you here?
芙蕾雅让我过来劝你回去，我总得要装装样子吧。,Freyja asked me to persuade you to go back. So I've got to at least look like I tried to.
虽然现在的我不大想向你挥动锤子，不过……,"I don't really feel like fighting you, but..."
动手吧，要是不通过我这关，今天你可见不到芙蕾雅了。,"Do it, otherwise you can't see Freyja today."
你的本事比以前强多了呐……,You are much stronger than before.
不好意思，差点失控，我希望没有伤着你。,"I almost lost control of myself, I'm sorry. I hope I didn't hurt you."
看到你如今的成长我挺高兴，你以前糟糕的性格，可从不会主动和其他北欧女神和好。,I am proud to see how much you've grown. No one would have believed you'd take the initiative to reconcile with Freyja.
神也是会改变的，至少我是这样。,"Even immortal gods can change. At least, I have."
呵呵……记得告诉芙蕾雅，你把我打了个落花流水，不然她可不甘心。,"Remember to tell Freyja you kicked my butt, hehe. Otherwise I'll get in trouble."
你还是来了，我的妹妹，弗丽嘉。,"After everything, you still came. My sister, Frigga."
我是来与你和解的，姐姐，当年为了天后的权位，我做过不少让你伤心的残酷之事。,"I have come to reconcile with you, sister. I did many cruel things to you, for the sake of being Queen."
我不会因此而对你产生偏见，你需要和解的是你自己。,It is not me you need to reconcile with. It is yourself.
以前在天后这个位置的争夺中，我没有像个北欧勇士一样和你在战斗中分出胜负……,"In the fight for the throne, I did not face you like a true Asgardian warrior..."
而是使用了权术、诡计和不公平的手段。,"Instead, I used subterfuge and trickery to win."
的确如此，但我已经原谅你了，继续纠结只会让你的内心继续沉沦，如果你实在难以释怀……,"That is true, but I have forgiven you. Allowing such feelings to fester in your heart will only cause you pain. But if you really can't let go..."
……那么一场迟到的对决，或许能够平抚你内心的愧疚。,"Then perhaps a duel may help to appease the guilt in your heart. Come sister, let us face each other as true Asgardian warriors."
你说的没错，让我们开始吧。,You are right. Let's do it.
看吧，即使是公平的战斗，你如今还是能胜过我，这也是我不反对你作为天后的原因。,"See, even in a fair fight, you have the power to defeat me now. That is why I have no objections to you being Queen."
但是……,But...
我看得出来，你还是不肯放下自责，依旧会受到不安之心的折磨。,I see that you still cannot forgive yourself and will be tormented by your own guilt.
告诉我，你真的能抛弃曾经的自己，接受我的原谅了吗？,"Tell me, are you willing to let go of your former self and accept my forgiveness?"
我明白了，我会消除自己内心的阴影。,"I understand, sister. I will chase away the shadows in my heart."
那就面对她，然后从她手中夺回你的意志！,"Then face your past self, and take back your willpower!"
我还没有想清楚这一切……,I need time to figure this all out...
那么我会一直守护你，直到你能真正面对自己过去的那一天。,Then I will watch over you until the day when you are ready to face your past.
呵呵，你又回来了，我的另一半。,"Hehe, you returned to me, my other half."
这么长时间没有品尝鲜血的滋味了，一定很怀念那种味道吧？我们的玫瑰园还在吗？,"We haven't tasted blood in so long... You must miss it, right? Is our blood-soaked rose garden still alive?"
我已经不再培育玫瑰了，那块土地，如今已经成为了阿斯加德众神的乐园。,I no longer grow roses. That land has now become a paradise for the gods of Asgard.
我真难以理解，阴谋与诡计曾让你得到天后的权力，但如今你却这么轻易地抛弃了。,"Tsk. I don't understand you. You stopped at nothing to become Queen, but now you are willing to throw it away so easily."
如今的我已经不需要依靠那些手段了，令人不齿的行为即使得到权力，也无法让众神信服。,"I will no longer rely on those methods. Even if I gain power through such disgraceful deeds, power alone will not convince the gods."
我哪怕失去自己的地位，也要换回自己在众神眼中真正的荣耀和尊严！,I must regain my honor and dignity in the eyes of the gods. Even if it costs me the throne!
你真的做得到吗？尽管来试试吧……,Can you really do it? Go ahead and try...
呵呵……我没想到自己真的会有被你击败的这一天……,I didn't think that you would actually defeat me...
是的，我将与你道别，与过去的自己道别。,"I will say goodbye to you, to my old self."
你成长了不少呢……但作为你曾经的阴影，我不会这么容易就消散的……,"You have grown a lot... But I am your shadow, I will not disappear so easily..."
只要你内心还有不舍、愧疚和胆怯，只要你还放不下过去的不安，我就迟早会回来找你……,"As long as you still have regrets, guilt, and cowardice in your heart... As long as you still can't let go of the past... Sooner or later, I will return."
我会记住自己曾经的过错，但我绝不会因此而踌躇不前。,"I will remember my past mistakes, but I will no longer let them hold me back."
我拭目以待……,We shall see...

她是北欧神话中的天后，是家庭和婚姻的守护神。\n虽然贵为天后，但弗丽嘉更渴望以慈母的形象示人，她常化身老妪，替奥丁在凡间行善，亦或者是化身爱情使者，拯救那些相爱但被迫分离的情侣。,"In Norse mythology, Frigga is considered the queen of the gods and the protector of family and marriage. Although, she prefers to be thought of as a loving mother than a queen.\nFrigga often transforms into an old woman, doing good deeds for Odin on Midgard, or into a love messenger, saving those lovers who are in love but forced to separate."

哎呀，看看这是谁来了,"Oh my, look who we have here."
大名鼎鼎的战争之主，智慧与庇护的使者，雅典娜女神！,The famous Goddess of Wisdom and War! The mighty Athena!
奉承的话就不用多说了，我遇到了麻烦，需要你帮忙。,Stop with such flattery. I am in trouble and need your help.
等等……你的神力……好像消失了？究竟发生了什么？,Wait... Your divine power... It's gone! What has happened?
波塞冬挑起了战争，她发动大地震让雅典城沉入了海中，想将它变为新的亚特兰蒂斯。,Poseidon started a war! She caused an earthquake that sank Athens into the sea. She's trying to turn it into the new Atlantis!
于是你付出了全部的神格来拯救雅典城？你还真是慈悲为怀啊。,So you gave all of your divinity to save the city? How compassionate of you.
少说风凉话了，如果你真想帮忙，就把你的魔盒给我，我要用它来与波塞冬抗衡！,Cut the sarcastic comments. Just give me your magic box so I can use it to fight Poseidon.
很遗憾，那破玩意恐怕派不上什么用场。但是别担心，我有办法帮你重获神力。,Unfortunately my magic box doesn't work that way. But I do have a way to help you regain your powers.
很好，那接下来我们要怎么做？,Great! What do I have to do?
按照我的规矩，你得先通过进入梦境的试炼……然而你现在是凡人之身，能行吗？,"First of all, you have to pass my trial... But since you're mortal now, can you do it?"
呵……你最好别小瞧了凡人的力量！,Heh... You better not underestimate the power of mortals!
你输了，潘多拉，这场决斗是战争之主的胜利！,"You lost, Pandora. Victory belongs to me, the Goddess of War!"
看来即使失去神格的力量，你在战斗中也不见得会落下风。,"It seems that even without your divinity, you are not one to be underestimated in battle."
现在你可以告诉我你的计划了。,"Yes, now tell me your plan."
当然，只不过有点复杂。让我们去见见你的几个老朋友再说吧……,"Well, it's a bit difficult to explain. Before that, let's go meet some old friends of yours."
潘多拉，我可不记得邀请过你。,"Pandora, I don't remember inviting you here."
你不想见我无所谓，但这位女神大人想要见你可是件大事。,"It doesn't matter if you don't want to see me. But, this goddess here wants to see you."
雅典娜？我和你们这样的女神没什么好说的……等等，你身上没有神格的气息？,Athena? I have nothing to say to goddesses like you. Wait... you don't have a divine aura?
让我猜猜，你变成凡人了？想不到你也有今天。,Oh let me guess! You're mortal? Hehe I didn't expect to enjoy to have a treat like you today.
你口中的“今天”很快就要结束了，伴随着你被击败。,"I think you'll find she's no mere treat. Instead, you'll taste defeat today."
等一下，你们想干嘛？你以为你还是那个高高在上的战争女神吗？你只不过是一介凡人！,And how do you propose to do that? Do you think you're still the high and mighty Goddess of War? You're a mortal now!
没错，但凡人战胜神明的故事，你听得还不够多吗？,"Yes, I'm mortal. But don't you know? Even mortals can defeat gods."
没想到你即使失去几乎所有神力，还是能如此轻易地击败我。,I didn't expect you to defeat me so easily without your divinity.
奇怪，在与你的战斗中，我似乎感受到力量开始回归的迹象了。,Hmm it's strange but I think I feel the beginnings of my power returning.
看来我的梦境开始起作用了呢，你每次击败梦境中的对手，都将找回一部分神格。,Hehe. Then my plan is working. Every opponent you defeat in this dreamland will help you regain a part of your divinity.
这听起来可真让人兴奋，也就是说，我击败最后一个梦境中的对手时……,"How exciting. So, when I defeat my last opponent...?"
你的神格就完全恢复了。,Your divinity will be fully restored.
有意思，我会好好享受这个过程的，至于你……有兴趣作为见证者，与我同行么？,"This method seems right up my alley, I will enjoy it. As for you... Care to join me and witness it?"
不错的点子，我也想看看凡人重新获得神权的过程。,"Oh yes, I would like to see how a mortal can regain lost divinity."
我猜，这儿你应该比我熟。,Here's your next opponent. But I guess you're more familiar with her than I am.
在我还是神明的时候，她就是个非常难对付的家伙……,"Even when I was a goddess, she was rather difficult to deal with."
你忘了，曾经也有凡人击败过她，而且还是在你的帮助下，鼓起勇气吧。,"Don't forget, mortals have beaten her once before. With aid from none other than yourself."
别来无恙啊，美杜莎。,"Long time no see, Medusa."
雅典娜？你居然还敢出现在我的神庙门口……不对，你身上没有神格的气息……,"Athena? How dare you show your face in my temple? Hold on, your divinity is gone."
我用自己的神力保护了雅典城免受波塞冬的侵害。,"I protected the city of Athens against Poseidon's attack, using my divine power."
呵呵……这该说无私还是愚蠢呢？,What a selfless act. Or perhaps it's stupidity.
不过你居然在凡人的状态下来见曾经的敌人，我佩服你的勇气。,"And you actually came to meet me, your former enemy, in your mortal state. I admire your courage."
击败你并不是什么困难的事，我知道你的所有弱点。,You pose no threat to me. I already know all your weaknesses.
我很乐意在我的神庙里立一尊真正的“女神石像”！,Hehe well I'd love to have a statue of a goddess to decorate my temple.
认输吧，战争之主可不是靠运气取得胜利的。,"Throw in the towel, Medusa. The Goddess of War doesn't need to rely on luck to win."
算我倒霉！你想拿我怎么样？,"Aw, how unlucky for me! What do you want with me?"
安心，亲爱的，我只是借与你的这场战斗，取回我失去的一部分神力而已。,"Don't worry, my dear. I just used this battle with you to regain part of my lost divinity."
呵……上一个战胜我的凡人可是直接让我脑袋搬家了，话说回来你们打算去哪？,"Heh... The last mortal who defeated me removed my head. Speaking of, where are you going?"
还能去哪，当然是帮女神取回神力，然后找波塞冬算总帐。,"Where else? To regain the rest of my power, of course. And then to settle things with Poseidon."
如果你是要找波塞冬麻烦，算我一个，她这次干的太过分了，把我的神庙淹了大半。,"If you're going after Poseidon, count me in! She flooded my temple."
我从没想过，有一天还能和你站在同一条阵线上。,I never thought that one day we would be on the same side.
别得意忘形了，我们只是暂时合作而已。,Don't get carried away. This is only a temporary truce. Let's go.
潘多拉，你带我来冥界干什么？我现在可是凡人，进去后可就很难再出来了。,"Pandora, why have you brought me to the underworld? You know mortals cannot easily escape once stepping foot in here."
放心，我们只是前往方塔苏斯的噩梦而已，并不需要渡过冥河。,"Calm down, we're only going as far as the nightmare controlled by Phantasos. We don't need to cross the river Styx."
我老远就感受到你们的气息了，你们既不是亡者，也不是沉睡之人，来我这里干什么？,"I knew I sensed someone's aura approaching. You are neither dead nor asleep, what are you doing here?"
方塔苏斯，我需要你梦境中的一块精华结晶。,"Phantasos, I need a crystal formed from the essence of your dream."
暂且不说我会不会给你，我想先问问，你拿它是要做什么？,"Hmm... If I did give it to you, what are you planning to do with it?"
我们需要将它合成一种替代神格的载体，然后为雅典娜提供神力。,"We need to synthesize it into a replacement vessel for divinity, and then provide divine power to Athena."
哦……？曾经不可一世的智慧与战争女神，居然会把自己的神格弄丢？,Oh? The once incomparable Goddess of Wisdom and War has actually lost her divinity?
不过我可不是慈善家，想要的话，你们就来抢吧。,"But I am not a philanthropist. If you want it, you will have to take it."
以智慧与战争女神之名，那我就不客气了。,"Then in the name of the Goddess of Wisdom and War, prepare yourself!"
我不明白，你是如何以凡人之躯击破我的梦境的？,I do not understand. How are you able to shatter my nightmare as a mortal?
或许力量是制胜的一环，但智慧才是关键，你太过傲慢，否认了智慧对于凡人的重要性。,"Strength may be the door to victory, but wisdom is the key. You failed to see that because of your arrogance."
不管如何，我输给你是事实，就给你一块梦境结晶好了。,"Well whatever, the fact is I lost to you. I will give you a dream crystal."
另外，不如让我和你一块前行，看看你所谓的智慧是如何在战场上体现的。,"In addition, let me go with you to see how your so-called wisdom is reflected on the battlefield."
我并不反对，噩梦之神。,"I have no objection, Goddess of Nightmares."
接下来我们去黄道吧，去上面收集星辰之光，唤醒梦境结晶的能量。,"Next, let's go to the Zodiac, to collect the light of the stars and awaken the energy of the dream crystal."
这是黄道禁地，奥林匹斯的女神们，这里不属于你们该来的地方。,"This is the forbidden area of the Zodiac. Goddesses of Olympus, this place is not for you."
没关系，我只需要黄道上的一点星光。,"It's okay, we just need a little starlight from the Zodiac."
我记得你，你是雅典娜……,"I remember you, Athena..."
我也记得你，潘神，是我用计策把你变成现在这副模样的。,"I also remember you, Goddess Pan. It was I who used trickery to turn you into what you are now."
虽然我没有愤怒，也感受不到复仇的意义，但是我内心的正义驱使着我向你讨要公道。,"...I am not angry, nor do I want revenge, but the righteousness in my heart drives me to seek justice from you."
我接受你的正义，来吧，以战斗来做个了断也是一种荣耀。,"I accept your justice. Come, it's an honor to end it with a fight."
虽然你的正义并没有获得胜利，但我欣赏你不屈的意志。,"Although your justice did not prevail, I admire your unyielding will."
胜利女神今天并不青睐我，好吧，你可以拿走黄道的任何东西作为战利品。,"Victory doesn't favor me today. Well, you can take anything from the Zodiac as your prize."
不用担心，我只需要一点点星光而已。,"Don't worry, all I need is a little bit of starlight."
雅典娜，你是在尝试寻回丢失的神格吗？或许我能在接下来的旅程中助你一臂之力？,"Athena, are you trying to recover your lost divinity? Perhaps I can help you on your journey?"
你真的愿意帮助我吗？即使是在我曾经伤害过你的情况下。,Are you really willing to help me? Even though I have hurt you in the past.
事实上，从潘神变成摩羯座，并不是什么太难以接受的事情。,"The truth is, changing from the Goddess Pan to Capricornus was not too difficult to accept."
雅典娜？你为什么会到黄道众星的梦境里来？,Athena? Why have you come to the dreams of the Zodiac?
别来无恙，我遇到了点小麻烦。,It's been a while. I need a bit of help.
你身上……好像不再拥有神格了？,You... don't seem to have your divinity anymore?
这都拜波塞冬所赐。,It's all thanks to Poseidon.
我听说过你和波塞冬的战争。所以你是想从这里的传送门，直接前往波塞冬的宫殿？,I've heard of your war with Poseidon. So you want to use the portal here to go straight to Poseidon's palace?
没错。,That's right.
恐怕以你的凡人身躯无法在海洋待太久吧？我可以赋予你让凡人在海底呼吸的力量。,You won't be able to stay in the ocean for long with your mortal body. I can give you the power to breathe underwater.
但碍于我传送门守护者身份，我无法直接将这种能力给你，除非你在战斗中……,"But due to my status as the guardian of the portal, I can't just give you this ability..."
我明白了，我会对你手下留情的。,I understand. I'll go easy on you.
快停手！真没想到你失去了神力还是这样所向披靡。,Stop! I really didn't expect you to still be so powerful after losing your divinity.
谢谢你，亲爱的。,"Thank you, my dear."
别在意，我只是帮了伟大的智慧与战争女神一个小忙而已。,"Of course, I'm just doing the great Goddess of Wisdom and War a small favor."
我是大海与星空之门的守护者，你们是谁？来海底世界想做什么？,"I am the Guardian of the Sea and the Celestial Gate, who are you? What do you want in the underwater world?"
和我一样的形象……梦境通道的守护者吗？,Is this phantom that looks like me... the guardian of the dream passage?
海底的梦境并不允许你这样的存在。,The dream under the sea does not allow for an existence such as you to enter.
遗憾的是，我也不希望你这样的存在出现在阻挡我的道路上！,"Unfortunately, I also don't want an existence like you to stand in my way!"
真是强大的力量，好久没有看到如此精湛的战斗技巧了。,What a powerful display! It's been a long time since I saw such exquisite fighting skills.
看来我已经恢复了大部分的神格，继续前进吧，我想尽快回到现实。,"Looks like I've regained most of my divine power. Let's move on, I want to get back to the waking world as soon as possible."
波塞冬！我现在就站在你的宫殿门口，难道要我把你的王座拆了，你才肯出来面对我吗？,Poseidon! I am standing in front of your palace right now. Come out and face me! Or do you want me to tear down your throne first?
雅典娜，作为一个丢了神格的女神，我挺敬佩你还敢在梦境中找我对峙。,"Athena, I admire you for daring to confront me in the dreamland, even without your divinity."
波塞冬，我难以原谅你将雅典淹没的罪行，我将以战争女神的身份向你问罪！,"Poseidon, I cannot forgive you for flooding Athens. As the Goddess of War, you will face my judgement!"
我以为你在丢失神格后，能理解我现在的处境，但看来我想多了。,"I thought you could understand my current situation after losing your divinity, but it seems that I was hoping for too much."
不，我明白你在降临现实世界后，失去原有的神力是一件痛苦的事情。,"No, I understand that it was painful for you to lose your original divinity when you descended into the mortal world."
但将全世界化为海洋，并不能成为你为了获取力量的借口。,But that's no reason to flood the whole world!
那么没有必要多说什么了，只有战斗能解决问题！,Then there is nothing more to be said. We can only fight!
一切结束了，波塞冬！让海水褪去，这件事我可以既往不咎。,"It's over, Poseidon! Let the seas recede, and I will let this matter go."
不，这是我唯一能够找回神格与力量的方式，我不能就这样放弃。,"No, this is the only way I can regain my divine power and strength. I can't just give up like this."
很好，如果你有胆量，我会给你第二次机会的。,"Very well, I will give you a second chance if you dare."
雅典娜，接下来的战斗，就由我来代替波塞冬吧。,"Athena, I will step in for Poseidon in the next battle."
宙斯？怎么是你？！,Zeus! Why?
波塞冬是我的姐妹，你应该对她保持应有的尊重。,"Poseidon is my sister, and you should treat her with the respect she deserves."
我很抱歉，如果她没有试图伤害我的子民，我很乐意这么做，但现在……,"I'd be happy to do so if she hadn't tried to harm my people, but now..."
那就由我来代替她和你战斗吧。,Then let me fight you instead of her.
……这并不是我所期待的。,...That's not what I expected.
你瞒不了我，作为战争女神，你早就渴望着和我对决的这一天了，没错吧？,"You can't hide it from me. As the Goddess of War, you've been longing for the day when you get to face me in battle, right?"
呵呵……你好像看上去挺犹豫的，雅典娜大人，需要我再给你点自信？,"Hehe. You seem to be hesitant, Lady Athena. Do you need me to give you some confidence?"
不……我会以凡人的身躯面对这场战斗。,No. I will face this battle in the body of a mortal.
是我的胜利，即使是失去神格，我依然以凡人的身份战胜了众神之王。,"It is my victory! Even without my original divinity, I still defeated the Ruler of Olympus."
没错，雅典娜，你胜利了，你的仁慈与智慧，配得上你重新找回的神力。,"Yes, Athena, you are victorious. Your kindness and wisdom are worthy of your rediscovered power."
或许我们都该好好反省一下，作为神，我们是否都陷入了永恒的傲慢之中。,"Perhaps we should all reflect on whether we, as gods, have fallen into eternal arrogance."
话别说得这么冠冕堂皇，雅典娜，特洛伊之战的时候，你对特洛伊的子民又做了什么呢？,"Don't talk so grandly, Athena, or did you forget what you did to the people of Troy during the Trojan War?"
阿波罗？是你？！,Apollo?!
你或许仁慈，但是否只是对自己的子民呢？对待他邦之民，你难道没有尽情宣泄怒火吗？,"You may be merciful, but isn't it only to your own people? Haven't you vented your anger against the people of other countries?"
……我很抱歉，阿波罗，对于战争我始终都力求公正，但当时是你们让我别无选择。,"...I'm sorry, Apollo. I've always tried to be fair in wars, but you had left me with no other choice."
以你现在的力量与我一战吧，如果你赢了，那我就认可你的意志！,"Fight me with your current power. If you win, then I will recognize your will!"
那就拔出你的武器吧！,Then draw your weapon!
很好，我很敬佩你的勇气和敢于面对责任之心。,"Very well, I admire your courage and willingness to face responsibility."
既然这样……让我们脱下盔甲，像两个人类一样解决恩怨吧！,Let us take off our armor and settle our grievances like two mortals!
我无心与你战斗，这是没有意义之举！,"I have no intention of fighting you, it's pointless!"
哼！如我所想的一样啊，智慧女神确实从不冲动。,"Hmph! As I thought, the Goddess of Wisdom is not impulsive."
那我们就在将来的战场上再决胜负吧，你带着雅典大军，而我则带着马其顿勇士！,"Then let's decide the outcome on a future battlefield. You lead the Athenian army, and I will lead the Macedonian warriors!"
我接受你的挑战，这场凡人之身的战斗，如果我胜利了，希望你能够放下过去的恩怨。,"I accept your challenge, this mortal battle. If I win, I hope you can let go of the grievances of the past."
没问题，让我们开始吧。,No problem... if you win. Let's get started!
呵……长本事了啊，智慧与战争女神，如果是之前的你，必然会被我击败。,"Heh you really are skilled, Goddess of Wisdom and War. If it were the former you, it would have been my victory. But now..."
事实上我还让你你几招，如果全力以赴，这场战斗会更快结束。,"In fact, I also let you show me your moves. If I went all out, the fight would have been over too soon."
哼，就算你赢了吧，我们彼此间不再有恩怨。,"Hmph! Even if you say that, you did win, so we no longer have any grudges against each other."
但我希望你将来能践行自己对于正义的原则，无论是对自己的子民，还是对外邦人。,But I hope that in the future you will be fair and just not only for your own people but also everyone else.
我必不会再让任何人失望。,I will never let anyone down again.
启航,Sailing
同为北欧最有魅力的女神，我和芙蕾雅，你会更青睐谁呢？,"Of the two most charming goddesses of the Nordic region, who would you favor more, Freyja or me?"
北欧众神们总说爱情会让人付出盲目的牺牲，果真如此吗？,Nordic gods often say love involves blind sacrifices. Is that so?
听说，用相爱之人的血来浇灌玫瑰，会赋予它们强大的魔力……,I heard that watering roses with the blood of a loved one bestows them with powerful magic…
我喜欢事物凋零时的感觉，就像蔷薇被铁锤敲碎的瞬间，也有一种独特的美……,I enjoy watching things wilt. The end result reminds me of roses smashed by a hammer. Beauty can be found even in its own destruction.
我听说维纳斯对爱情之事颇有看法，挺想和她见上一面呢。,"I’ve heard that Venus has quite some views on love, I’d like to meet her."
我喜欢那些可爱美丽的东西，喜欢到想要把它们都捏碎……,"I love adorable and beautiful things, so much that I want to crush them all…"
当然是你！,"Of course, it’s you!"
这个嘛……你猜猜？,Well… Take a guess?
我想并非如此。,I don’t think it necessarily is.
我确实这么认为。,I believe so.
我听过这样的传闻！,I’ve heard such rumors as well!
应该是假的吧？,It sounds like a myth to me.
索尔应该会有同感。,Thor would probably feel the same.
听上去有点可怕……,That sounds a bit disturbing…
我有不好的预感……,I have a bad feeling about this…
或许是个好点子。,Maybe that’s a good idea.
你有照过镜子吗？,Have you ever looked in the mirror?
呃……对我也是一样？,Er… the same goes for me?
是吗？呵呵……这句话是真话，还是谎话呢……？,"Really? Is that the truth, or are you lying?"
哼，你好像在犹豫呢，是想成为我玫瑰园中的养料吗？,"Hmm, you seem to hesitate. Would you rather become fertilizer in my rose garden."
可如果不能为了爱而牺牲，那还算真挚的爱吗？,But isn’t love without sacrifice less genuine?
那么，你会为了我牺牲什么呢？,"So, what would you sacrifice for me?"
那么猜猜看，接下来我要对你做什么刺激的事情了呢……,So guess what exciting thing I am about to do next…
有意思！我们来验证一下怎么样……？,Interesting! Shall we test it?
她小时候可喜欢找我玩了，使用战锤的本事我可没少教她。,"As a child, she enjoyed playing with me. I taught her a lot about wielding a hammer."
哼，在战场上看到我击碎魔物的身姿后，我相信你会理解这种美感的。,"Hmph, after witnessing me pulverizing monsters on the battlefield, I believe you would understand."
为什么呢？我只是想和她分享一下恋爱的经验啊。,"As a child, she enjoyed playing with me. I taught her a lot about wielding a hammer."
我也这么觉得，至少作为爱神，她能理解我对爱情的理念。,"I think so too, at least as a goddess of love, she would understand my philosophy of love."
你是想问我会不会对自己也产生这样的想法？不瞒你说，的确会有……,"Are you asking if I’ve had the same thought about myself? Indeed, I have…"
猜对了呢，我确实想把你用力抱在怀里，享受你慢慢窒息的过程……,"You guessed it. I indeed want to hold you tight in my arms, relishing in your slow suffocation…"
暂未拥有该女神，是否确认选择,Angel not owned. Confirm your choice?
