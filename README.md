# ia_dump

Okay so I should fill this out by now. Still learning stuff. I don't really know wtf I'm doing. What what *am* I trying to do?

### The Goal
I just wanna know stuff. But I'm using this desire to teach myself how to use python to figure it out while I pursue a data analyst degree.
I do have a functional reason for dumping this data into a github repository though. 

### A Project
I want to teach myself how to make a Discord bot to let users retrieve information. I have an idea of how to do this, which required me creating a place to host the assets and files in a way that I can keep the data up-to-date where the bot can reliably access it. 

### The Bot
I want it to do a few things: retrieve info for entities like angels, eudemons, relics, etc; compare stats with relevance (such as a spider chart that compares a carry's offensive stats against of offensive angels in it's class); call up tables of useful data; lookup dungeon bosses. Pretty much make it a resource for info that we can use within a discord server. Furthermore, I can use this for my final project of my degree program.

But that's all for now. As I learn more, the scope of what I do may increase. For now, the goal is to just know more.
